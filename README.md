## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v1) |This approach utilizes long-context LLMs by preloading all relevant documents and precomputing the key-value (KV) cache in advance. The preloaded context enables the model to deliver contextually accurate answers without requiring real-time retrieval. The authors propose that CAG serves as an effective alternative to RAG for scenarios where the retrievable documents or knowledge are limited and manageable in size. |
|[Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04227) |This approach employs LLM agents to perform the entire research process. Key findings include: 1) agents powered by o1-preview deliver the best research outcomes, 2) generated machine learning code achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, 3) human feedback enhances research quality, and 4) Agent Laboratory drastically reduces research costs. |
|[Long Context vs. RAG for LLMs: An Evaluation and Revisits.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01880) |This study evaluates long-context (LC) LLMs against RAG systems, with three key findings: 1) LC generally outperforms RAG on question-answering benchmarks, 2) summarization-based retrieval performs on par with LC, while chunk-based retrieval falls behind, and 3) RAG excels in dialogue-based and general question queries. |
|[Search-o1: Agentic Search-Enhanced Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05366) | This framework integrates large reasoning models (LRMs) with agentic search and document refinement capabilities to address knowledge insufficiency. It facilitates autonomous knowledge retrieval during reasoning and achieves superior performance on complex tasks, surpassing both baseline models and human experts.|
