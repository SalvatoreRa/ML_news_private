# ML news: 

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Chain of Draft for Efficient Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600) | Chain of Draft is a concise reasoning strategy that significantly reduces token usage while matching or exceeding Chain-of-Thought accuracy across complex tasks.|
|[RAG-MCP: Mitigating Prompt Bloat in LLM Tool Selection via Retrieval-Augmented Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03275) | This paper reveals that adding too many tools to AI agents can backfire, causing prompt overload and reduced accuracy. To fix this, RAG-MCP uses a retrieval-based method that selects only the most relevant tool schemas from a large external index, keeping prompts concise and effective. It cuts prompt size by over half and triples tool-selection accuracy, enabling scalable, efficient multi-tool agents without retraining.|
|[Long-Short Chain-of-Thought Mixture Supervised Fine-Tuning Eliciting Efficient Reasoning in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03469v1) |This paper introduces LS-Mixture SFT, a method that fine-tunes LLMs on both long and trimmed chain-of-thought reasoning to reduce verbosity without sacrificing accuracy. By training on a 50/50 mix of detailed and concise reasoning paths and prompting for balanced outputs, the s1-mix-32B model achieves up to 6.7 points higher accuracy with 47% shorter responses across tasks like MATH500 and AIME24—proving efficient reasoning doesn't require overthinking. |
|[Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) | Absolute Zero introduces a self-supervised learning approach where an LLM generates and solves its own reasoning tasks without human data, using only code execution for feedback. By evolving task difficulty and optimizing for learnability, a unified model trained with Task-Relative REINFORCE++ achieves state-of-the-art results in coding and math benchmarks, outperforming models trained on human-curated examples and demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.|
|[Rethinking Memory in AI: Taxonomy, Operations, Topics, and Future Directions.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00675v1) |"Rethinking Memory in AI" introduces a unified taxonomy of memory in LLM agents, dividing it into parametric, contextual-structured, and contextual-unstructured types, with six core operations: consolidation, indexing, updating, forgetting, retrieval, and compression. Analyzing 30,000+ papers, the framework guides when to store, graph, or edit memory, offering a precise toolkit for building more reliable, long-lived AI systems that adapt across sessions and domains. |
|[HyperTree Planning: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Hierarchical Thinking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02322v1) |HyperTree Planning (HTP) replaces linear chains of thought with hierarchical hypertrees to improve LLM planning accuracy by up to 3.6x. It decomposes complex queries into subtasks using a top-down approach, expands branches with rule libraries, and prunes candidates using model-based scoring. Without hand-crafted examples, HTP outperforms chain, tree, and agent methods on benchmarks like TravelPlanner and Blocksworld, pointing to hypertrees as a scalable future for LLM-driven planning. |
|[L1: Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks With Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04697v1) | A new method from Carnegie Mellon, Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), trains models to reason accurately within user-specified length limits, addressing inefficiencies from overly long or prematurely short outputs. Their 1.5B L1 model balances accuracy and compute use, outperforming previous methods by up to 20% and even rivaling GPT-4o at matched reasoning lengths—despite being 30× smaller. LCPO points to length control as a key advance for efficient, lightweight AI reasoning.|
|[Code Retrieval using LoRA.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05315) | Researchers introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method for code search that reduces trainable parameters below 2% while improving retrieval accuracy by up to 9.1% for Code2Code tasks.|
|[IDInit: A Universal and Stable Initialization Method for Neural Network Training.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04626) | A new initialization technique, IDInit, ensures stable convergence in deep neural networks by maintaining identity transitions in both main and sub-stem layers.|
|[The Leaderboard Illusion.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879) |Chatbot Arena's benchmarking shows bias stemming from hidden private tests and unequal data access. Companies like Google and OpenAI have broad access, while open-source models get far less, leading to overfitting instead of real model progress. |
|[Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03710) | A new actor-critic RL algorithm has achieved near-optimal sample efficiency using offline data and targeted exploration, addressing long-standing challenges in hybrid RL settings.|
