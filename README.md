|[Document Reranking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439v1) | LLM4Ranking is a recently introduced modular framework that works with both open and closed LLMs for document reranking, offering evaluation tools and reproducible benchmarks on well-known datasets.|
|[d1: Scaling Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12216) |The d1 framework enhances masked diffusion language models through a two-stage process: supervised fine-tuning on a small dataset followed by task-specific reinforcement learning using the novel diffu-GRPO method. This approach enables efficient gradient updates via random prompt masking, achieving strong performance gains on reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH500, outperforming similarly sized models while benefiting from longer outputs and faster convergence. |
|[Leveraging Reasoning Model Answers to Enhance Non-Reasoning Model Capability.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09639) |Researchers show that smaller models can gain strong reasoning abilities by being fine-tuned on final answers (and optionally summarized reasoning) from large LLMs. Using a curated 1.3M-instance dataset, they test different distillation strategies, finding that training on final answers alone boosts math/coding accuracy, while combining with summarized thoughts aids alignment tasks. Results highlight trade-offs in including reasoning traces and suggest future blending techniques for improved performance. |
|[Visual Reasoning with Less Data.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934v1) | Using MCTS to quantify sample difficulty, ThinkLite-VL improves reasoning in VLMs with just 11k training samples and no distillation|
