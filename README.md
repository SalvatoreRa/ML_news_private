|[Humanity’s Last Exam.](https://static.scale.com/uploads/654197dc94d34f66c0f5184e/Publication%20Ready%20Humanity's%20Last%20Exam.pdf) | Humanity's Last Exam is a new multi-modal benchmark designed to push the boundaries of large language models (LLMs). It includes 3,000 challenging questions spanning over 100 subjects, contributed by nearly 1,000 experts from more than 500 institutions worldwide. Current leading AI models struggle with this benchmark, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving the highest accuracy at just 9.4%, highlighting substantial gaps in AI performance. Intended to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark, it addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks like MMLU, which have become too easy as models now exceed 90% accuracy. Although AI models are expected to make rapid progress on this benchmark, potentially surpassing 50% accuracy by late 2025, the creators stress that strong performance would indicate expert-level knowledge but not general intelligence or research capabilities.|
