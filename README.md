|[Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009) | The paper introduces Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method designed to drastically reduce memory usage in LLM training by optimizing the computation of cross-entropy loss. Traditional cross-entropy layers can consume up to 90% of memory in some models by storing logits for the entire vocabulary. CCE addresses this by calculating logits only for the correct token and dynamically evaluating the log-sum-exp over all logits using flash memory. This approach reduces the memory footprint of Gemma 2 from 24GB to just 1MB. By leveraging the sparsity in softmax calculations, it skips elements that have minimal impact on gradients.

There is no universally optimal format across models or tasks; for example, GPT-3.5-turbo performed better with JSON, while GPT-4 favored Markdown. Models within the same family exhibited similar format preferences, but these preferences did not translate well to different model families. The findings highlight the significant impact of prompt formatting on model performance, emphasizing the importance of considering format choice during prompt engineering, model evaluation, and application development. |
