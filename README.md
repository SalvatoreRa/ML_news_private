# ML news: 

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837) |This paper finds that while RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves sample efficiency in LLMs, it doesn't enhance reasoning beyond what the base model can already generate. RLVR boosts pass\@1 scores but is matched or surpassed by base models at higher k, suggesting it merely increases the chance of sampling known solutions. True reasoning gains come from distillation, not RL, which narrows exploration without expanding capability. |
|[Sleep-Time Compute for LLM Efficiency.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13171v1) |A new method to cut LLM inference costs by precomputing relevant context information ahead of user queries, achieving up to 5x faster test-time performance and improved accuracy on reasoning tasks. |
|[Robust Autonomy Emerges from Self-Play.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03349) |This study introduces a simulated self-driving agent that achieved two years without a collision, trained entirely through self-play and marking a significant advancement over the previous state-of-the-art trained on Gigaflow.|
|[AlphaGeometry 2.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03544) |DeepMind has launched an updated version of its geometry model, boosting accuracy to 84% from the previous 54%, with key gains driven by the Gemini language model and enhanced search techniques. |
|[UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12326) | UI-TARS is an end-to-end, vision-based GUI agent that interacts with interfaces purely via screenshots, integrating perception, reasoning, action, and memory without external scripts. Trained on rich visual data, it excels in perception, grounding, and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing models like GPT-4o and Claude. With features like internal “thoughts” and reflective learning, UI-TARS adapts to errors and dynamic tasks, setting new standards in GUI automation across platforms.|
|[TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084) | Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) lets LLMs improve during inference by using majority voting over their own outputs to create pseudo-rewards, enabling reinforcement learning without labeled data. Combining test-time scaling and training, it adapts models to new inputs. TTRL boosts performance significantly, even surpassing its own supervision baseline, though it relies on the model's prior knowledge and well-tuned settings to work effectively. |
|[Discovering Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/18d20cca3cde3503/original/Values-in-the-Wild-Paper.pdf) |This study analyzes over 300,000 real conversations with Claude 3 and 3.5, identifying 3,307 AI-expressed values across five domains. Practical and epistemic values dominate, with Claude often emphasizing helpfulness, professionalism, and clarity. Values vary by context, becoming most explicit during resistance or reframing. Claude mirrors user values in supportive settings but resists unethical requests. Claude 3 Opus shows deeper emotional and ethical grounding than later Sonnet versions. |
