|[An Emulator for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models using Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12962) |What would happen if we combined the knowledge learned by a large model during pre-training with the knowledge learned by a small model during fine-tuning (or vice versa)? Our experiments with EFT show that scaling up fine-tuning tends to improve helpfulness while scaling up pre-training tends to improve factuality.  |
