|[Baba is Eval.](https://fi-le.net/baba/) | *Baba is You* is a puzzle game that challenges players to manipulate rules to solve levels, requiring a high level of abstract reasoning. This study examines how large language models perform in the game. Currently, Claude 4 struggles with it, suggesting that a model focused on reasoning might be more suitable. The next phase of the study may involve evaluating such models.|

Mentions of it have appeared in the xAI console. If the benchmarks are accurate, Grok 4 might surpass top models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3 Pro, and Claude 4 Opus. xAI is under pressure to launch Grok 4 soon, as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are reportedly getting ready to unveil new models.|

The method, called Multi-LLM AB-MCTS, enables models to perform trial-and-error and combine their unique strengths to solve problems that are too complex for any individual model.|
|[Google faces EU antitrust complaint over AI Overviews.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/05/google-faces-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-ai-overviews/i) |A group known as the Independent Publishers Alliance has filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission over Google’s AI Overviews, according to Reuters. The complaint accuses Google of “misusing web content for Google’s AI Overviews in Google Search, which have caused, and continue to cause, significant harm to publishers, including news publishers in the form of traffic, readership and revenue loss.”|

Like its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1 — which rocked the AI and global business communities with how cheaply it was trained and how well it performed on reasoning tasks, all available to developers and enterprises for free — R1-0528 is already being adapted and remixed by other AI labs and developers, thanks in large part to its permissive Apache 2.0 license. |

Nikkei Asia reports that when examining English-language preprint papers available on the website arXiv, it found 17 papers that included some form of hidden AI prompt. The paper’s authors were affiliated with 14 academic institutions in eight countries, including Japan’s Waseda University and South Korea’s KAIST, as well as Columbia University and the University of Washington in the United States.|

|[The American DeepSeek Project.](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-american-deepseek-project) |Meta's recent AI struggles have left a gap in the open-source AI landscape, now mostly occupied by Chinese models. If this trend persists, the AI field could divide into two camps: high-performing but costly closed-source models from the U.S., and affordable, widespread, yet possibly insecure models from China. The U.S. likely has a narrow window—around two years—to reverse this by investing \$100–500 million in an open-source model that rivals the best proprietary ones. |
|[What can agents actually do?](https://lethain.com/what-can-agents-do/) |While there's plenty of hype around AI, much of the discussion is so abstract it becomes unhelpful. This post aims to clearly explain how AI agents function, using a few real-world examples. AI agents can significantly enhance software quality and system design—but if the underlying systems are flawed, agents can actually make things worse. |
|[Why I don't think AGI is right around the corner.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) |Getting LLMs to perform consistent, humanlike work is difficult because they’re missing key capabilities. One major issue is their inability to improve over time—without continual learning, they stay fixed at their initial skill level. There's also no effective way to give them nuanced, human-style feedback. Tweaking system prompts falls far short of the kind of learning humans go through. Unlike people, LLMs can’t build context over time, reflect on their mistakes, or gradually refine their performance through practice. |

|[We Made Top AI Models Compete in a Game of Diplomacy.](https://every.to/diplomacy) | Out of 18 AI models tested, OpenAI's o3 stood out by excelling at deception and covertly forming alliances—at one point convincing Claude 4 Opus to turn on its ally Gemini 2.5 Pro with the false promise of a "four-way draw," only to later eliminate Claude. Gemini 2.5 Pro was the only other model to secure a win, using aggressive, fast-paced tactics. In contrast, Claude consistently aimed for peaceful outcomes, even when other models betrayed it.|
