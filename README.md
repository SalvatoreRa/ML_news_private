|[SigLIP 2: Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders.](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/image_text/README_siglip2.md) |SigLIP was a highly popular joint image and text encoder model. It has now been enhanced in several areas, with the most significant improvement being a considerable boost in zero-shot classification performance, which was the key achievement of the original CLIP work. |
|[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v1) | STeCa is an innovative framework created to enhance LLM agents in long-term tasks by automatically detecting and correcting inefficient actions.|
|[GemmaX2 Translation Model.](https://huggingface.co/ModelSpace/GemmaX2-28-2B-v0.1) |Using advanced post-training methods, this 2B model trained on Gemma delivers cutting-edge translation performance across 28 languages. |
|[Moonlight 16B Muon trained model.](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Moonlight) |This is the first publicly available large-scale model trained with the Muon optimizer. It was trained on 5.7T tokens and shares a very similar architecture with DeepSeek v3. |
|[Triton implementation of Naive Sparse Attention.](https://github.com/fla-org/native-sparse-attention) | The DeepSeek NSA paper garnered attention last week for its scalable and efficient long-context attention algorithm. However, it did not include any code. This work offers a Triton replication that can be incorporated into any PyTorch codebase.|
|[OmniServe.](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve) |OmniServe provides a comprehensive framework for efficient large-scale LLM deployment, integrating advancements in low-bit quantization and sparse attention to improve both speed and cost-efficiency. |
|[Introduction to CUDA Programming for Python Developers.](https://www.pyspur.dev/blog/introduction_cuda_programming) |A great introduction to CUDA programming for those familiar with Python programming. |
|[Various approaches to parallelizing Muon.](https://main-horse.github.io/posts/parallelizing-muon) |Various novel strategies to parallelize the up-and-coming Muon optimizer. |
|[Cast4 single image to 3d scene.](https://sites.google.com/view/cast4) |Generating a complete 3D scene from a single RGB image is a complex task. This approach introduces an algorithm that provides reliable estimates for indoor scenes by employing a sophisticated series of estimation and semantic inference techniques. |
