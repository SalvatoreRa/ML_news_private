|[The Leaderboard Illusion.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879) |The Leaderboard Illusion reveals major flaws in the Chatbot Arena ranking system, showing that practices like selective score reporting, extreme data imbalances, silent model removals, and overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics distort LLM comparisons. Through analysis of 2M battles, the paper finds that private testing privileges and data access for proprietary models inflate scores and undermine fairness, making the leaderboard an unreliable measure of real-world model quality. |
|[LLMs Get Lost in Multi-Turn Conversation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120) | LLMs perform significantly worse in multi-turn conversations, with an average 39% drop in task performance due to unreliability and early, incorrect assumptions.|
|[Sakana AI Unveils "Continuous Thought Machine" With Brain-Inspired Neural Timing.](https://sakana.ai/ctm/) | Japanese AI company Sakana has created a new type of model where individual neurons retain memory of past actions and coordinate based on timing patterns. Though it lags behind traditional models in performance, it offers greater transparency into its reasoning process. Like recent models such as o3, its responses improve when given more time to process.|
|[DeepMind unveils ‘spectacular’ general-purpose science AI.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01523-z) |System improves chip designs and tackles unsolved maths problems, but has not been rolled out to researchers outside the company. |
