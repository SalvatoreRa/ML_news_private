|[OpenAI and MIT Exploring AI and Emotional Well-Being.](https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/) | MIT Media Lab and OpenAI are studying how users emotionally engage with ChatGPT, focusing on its effects on social and emotional well-being. The research highlights the varied ways people interact with AI conversational models and lays the groundwork for future studies on responsible AI use.|
|[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551) |This paper introduces a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) to tackle reward hacking and error propagation in fine-grained LLM reasoning. HRM evaluates multiple steps, improving self-correction and providing more reliable assessments than traditional Process Reward Models (PRM), which can penalize corrections. HRM’s multi-step feedback framework also mitigates reward hacking by discouraging short-sighted strategies. The paper also presents Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which reduces the computational cost of generating annotations with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) while increasing dataset diversity. Experiments show that HRM outperforms standard models on complex tasks, providing better accuracy and more stable solutions. |
