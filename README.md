|---|---|
|[The Leaderboard Illusion.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879) |The Leaderboard Illusion reveals major flaws in the Chatbot Arena ranking system, showing that practices like selective score reporting, extreme data imbalances, silent model removals, and overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics distort LLM comparisons. Through analysis of 2M battles, the paper finds that private testing privileges and data access for proprietary models inflate scores and undermine fairness, making the leaderboard an unreliable measure of real-world model quality. |
|[LLMs Get Lost in Multi-Turn Conversation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120) | LLMs perform significantly worse in multi-turn conversations, with an average 39% drop in task performance due to unreliability and early, incorrect assumptions.|
|[Sakana AI Unveils "Continuous Thought Machine" With Brain-Inspired Neural Timing.](https://sakana.ai/ctm/) | Japanese AI company Sakana has created a new type of model where individual neurons retain memory of past actions and coordinate based on timing patterns. Though it lags behind traditional models in performance, it offers greater transparency into its reasoning process. Like recent models such as o3, its responses improve when given more time to process.|
|[AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms.](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/) |Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve employs Gemini models to iteratively create and refine full algorithmic solutions rather than isolated functions. It generates code, evaluates it automatically, and evolves better versions by building on successful attempts. This method has led to major improvements across Google’s infrastructure, including data center performance, chip design, and AI training efficiency. Some researchers will get early access, but broad availability remains uncertain. |
|[The effect of ChatGPT on students’ learning performance, learning perception, and higher-order thinking: insights from a meta-analysis.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y) | Amid ongoing discussions about AI in education, a meta-analysis of 51 studies reveals that ChatGPT significantly boosts student learning performance and moderately enhances perceptions of learning and higher-order thinking. Its impact was strongest in problem-based learning settings with regular use over 4–8 weeks.|
|[BLIP3-o: A Family of Fully Open Unified Multimodal Models-Architecture, Training and Dataset.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09568v1) | BLIP3-o is a new diffusion transformer architecture trained using a sequential pretraining approach. It sets state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal benchmarks. The release includes the model's code, pretrained weights, and a 60k instruction-tuning dataset.|

|[Journalists Reveal Nuanced Approaches to AI Integration.](https://www.cjr.org/feature-2/how-were-using-ai-tech-gina-chua-nicholas-thompson-emilia-david-zach-seward-millie-tran.php) |A survey of media professionals from outlets like Reuters, The Washington Post, VentureBeat, and 404 Media reveals that newsrooms are selectively integrating AI—using it for tasks like transcription, data analysis, and translation, but largely avoiding AI-generated content. While Reuters notes that AI now produces roughly 25% of its code, many journalists remain cautious, emphasizing audience trust and journalistic integrity over efficiency. |
|[ChatGPT is used for scientific research in countries where it's prohibited.](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00368/128867/Where-there-s-a-will-there-s-a-way-ChatGPT-is-used) | Researchers used a classifier to spot unique AI word choices—such as "delve"—in academic papers and found higher ChatGPT usage in countries where it's banned by OpenAI. By August 2023, 22% of Chinese preprints contained AI-generated content, compared to 11% in countries with legal access, indicating restrictions are easily bypassed. While ChatGPT use was linked to more views and downloads, it had no effect on citations or journal acceptance. |
|[Conversational Interfaces: the Good, the Ugly & the Billion-Dollar Opportunity.](https://lg.substack.com/p/conversational-interfaces-the-good) | Chat interfaces offer an easy entry point to LLMs for new users, but they're ultimately a design limitation that makes users adjust to the model instead of the other way around. Future assistants will feature more adaptive interfaces and proactively convey what they can do.|
|[Is it OK for AI to write science papers? Nature survey shows researchers are split.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01463-8) | Poll of 5,000 researchers finds contrasting views on when it’s acceptable to involve AI and what needs to be disclosed.|
|[AI's Second-Order Effects.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ais-second-order-effects-andrew-tan-fvoxc/) |Founders should consider AI's second-order impacts, such as shifts in workforce roles and regulatory demands, to drive sustainable growth. While first-order applications are becoming commoditized and competitive, real opportunities exist in addressing broader societal and economic changes spurred by AI. Building AI-native media and infrastructure can help tap into the transformative ways people respond to these disruptions. |
|[MCP is a powerful new AI coding technology: Understand the risks.](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/mcp-powerful-ai-coding-risk) | Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic AI to link LLMs with tools and data, currently lacks built-in security features, raising serious concerns. Experts have highlighted risks such as prompt injections and tool tampering. Without stronger safeguards, developers and organizations should use MCP cautiously, emphasize robust security practices, and keep up with its evolving standards.|
|[OpenAI Engineers Reveal How ChatGPT Images Handled 100M New Users in One Week.](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images) |OpenAI engineers shared how they handled the March launch of ChatGPT Images, which drew 100 million new users and 700 million images in its first week, with peak demand hitting 1 million new signups per hour during a viral surge in India. When their synchronous image generation system buckled under the pressure, the team rapidly rebuilt it into an asynchronous architecture during the launch. |
|[Agents, Tools, and Simulators.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ddK7CMEC3XzSmLS4G/agents-tools-and-simulators) |AI can be understood through three conceptual frameworks: as a tool, an agent, or a simulator—each offering unique perspectives on its potential and risks. Tools amplify human intent and need supervision; agents act autonomously to achieve goals; simulators replicate processes without inherent objectives. In the case of LLMs, simulator theory posits that they combine simulation with agent-like behavior, particularly when fine-tuned, reflecting a dual nature shaped by both their context of use and architectural design. |
|[How AI Agents Will Change the Web for Users and Developers.](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-will-change-the-web-for-users-and-developers/) | AI agents are set to reshape the web by autonomously interacting and sharing content, fundamentally changing user experiences and web development. This could lead to an "autonomous internet" where AI-driven interactions become the norm, influencing how content is structured, how payments work, and how businesses operate. Developers will need to adapt by building APIs tailored for AI agents and prioritizing scalable, personalized user experiences.|
|[a16z identifies nine key developer patterns in the AI era.](https://a16z.com/nine-emerging-developer-patterns-for-the-ai-era/) |Andreessen Horowitz identified nine key developer patterns emerging in the AI era. These patterns fundamentally reshaped how developers built software and what tools they used. |
