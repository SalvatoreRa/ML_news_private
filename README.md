|[OpenAI plans to shift compute needs from Microsoft to SoftBank.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/report-openai-plans-to-shift-compute-needs-from-microsoft-to-softbank/) |OpenAI is forecasting a major shift in the next five years around who it gets most of its computing power from, The Information reported on Friday. By 2030, OpenAI expects to get three-quarters of its data center capacity from Stargate, a project that’s expected to be heavily financed by SoftBank, one of OpenAI’s newest financial backers. |
|[Meta's DINOv2 for Cancer Research.](https://ai.meta.com/blog/orakl-oncology-dinov2-accelerating-cancer-treatment/) |Orakl Oncology utilizes Meta's DINOv2 model to speed up cancer drug discovery, enhancing efficiency by rapidly assessing organoid images to forecast patient treatment outcomes. | 
|[DeepSeek to open source parts of online services code.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/deepseek-to-open-source-parts-of-online-services-code/) |Chinese AI lab DeepSeek plans to open source portions of its online services’ code as part of an “open source week” event next week. DeepSeek will open source five code repositories that have been “documented, deployed and battle-tested in production,” the company said in a post on X on Thursday.|
|[Microsoft prepares for OpenAI’s GPT-5 model.](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/616464/microsoft-prepares-for-openais-gpt-5-model) | Microsoft is set to host OpenAI's GPT-4.5 model as soon as next week, with the more substantial GPT-5 release expected by late May. The GPT-5 system will incorporate OpenAI's new o3 reasoning model, aiming to unify AI capabilities. Both releases coincide with major tech events like Microsoft Build and Google I/O, highlighting Microsoft's strategic role in the AI sector.|

|[SigLIP 2: Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders.](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/image_text/README_siglip2.md) |SigLIP was a highly popular joint image and text encoder model. It has now been enhanced in several areas, with the most significant improvement being a considerable boost in zero-shot classification performance, which was the key achievement of the original CLIP work. |
|[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v1) | STeCa is an innovative framework created to enhance LLM agents in long-term tasks by automatically detecting and correcting inefficient actions.|
|[GemmaX2 Translation Model.](https://huggingface.co/ModelSpace/GemmaX2-28-2B-v0.1) |Using advanced post-training methods, this 2B model trained on Gemma delivers cutting-edge translation performance across 28 languages. |
|[Moonlight 16B Muon trained model.](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Moonlight) |This is the first publicly available large-scale model trained with the Muon optimizer. It was trained on 5.7T tokens and shares a very similar architecture with DeepSeek v3. |
|[Triton implementation of Naive Sparse Attention.](https://github.com/fla-org/native-sparse-attention) | The DeepSeek NSA paper garnered attention last week for its scalable and efficient long-context attention algorithm. However, it did not include any code. This work offers a Triton replication that can be incorporated into any PyTorch codebase.|
|[OmniServe.](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve) |OmniServe provides a comprehensive framework for efficient large-scale LLM deployment, integrating advancements in low-bit quantization and sparse attention to improve both speed and cost-efficiency. |
|[Introduction to CUDA Programming for Python Developers.](https://www.pyspur.dev/blog/introduction_cuda_programming) |A great introduction to CUDA programming for those familiar with Python programming. |
