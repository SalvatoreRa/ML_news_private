|[Learning to Reason without External Rewards.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19590) |INTUITOR is a reinforcement learning approach that uses a language model’s internal confidence as a reward signal, avoiding expensive domain-specific supervision. This method matches performance on math benchmarks and outperforms on coding tasks, providing an alternative to existing RL techniques that depend on verifiable rewards. |
|[Forward-only Diffusion Probabilistic Models.](https://algolzw.github.io/fod/) | FoD presents a forward-only generative modeling framework that employs a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation. This approach allows for non-Markov sampling and delivers competitive image generation results with fewer steps.|
