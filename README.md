|[Agents Are Not Enough.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2412.16241) |This work argues that AI agents, while promising, cannot fully solve the challenges of autonomous task execution. It proposes an ecosystem comprising three components: Agents (focused modules for specific tasks), Sims (digital representations of user preferences and behaviors), and Assistants (coordinators between users, Sims, and Agents). |
|[2 OLMo 2 Furious.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656) |This work introduces an improved architecture, advanced training methods, and a specialized data mixture called Dolmino Mix 1124. Released in 7B and 13B parameter scales with fully transparent training data and code, the model matches or exceeds the performance of open-weight models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while requiring fewer computational resources. Its instruction-tuned version, OLMo 2-Instruct, remains competitive with comparable models. |

|[Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark for Measuring Higher Level Mathematical Reasoning.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXnwlZe0yf&noteId=yrsGpHd0Sf) |Putnam-AXIOM, a new math reasoning benchmark, includes 236 Putnam Competition problems and 52 variations. The best-performing model, OpenAI's o1-preview, achieves only 41.95% accuracy on the original problems and fares significantly worse on the variations. |
