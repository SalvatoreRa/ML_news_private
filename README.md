|[How Hardware Limitations Have, and Will, Prevent Rapid AI Takeoffs.](https://epochai.substack.com/p/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities) |Key algorithmic advances in LLMs—such as transformers, multi-query attention, and mixture-of-experts—only yield major benefits (10–50x performance gains) when paired with massive compute resources. This reality challenges expectations of fast AI self-improvement, as hardware constraints like export controls, energy limits, and cooling infrastructure pose significant barriers to any rapid "intelligence explosion." |

|[Superhuman Coders in AI 2027.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QdaMzqaBJi6kupKtD/superhuman-coding-in-ai-2027-not-so-fast) |Superhuman coding by AI is now expected around 2033, later than AI Futures' earlier projections of 2028–2030. The delay stems from challenges like managing engineering complexity, operating without feedback loops, and meeting cost and speed requirements. Additional setbacks, such as geopolitical tensions or shifting priorities at leading labs, could extend the timeline even further. |
