|[The Levers of Political Persuasion with Conversational AI.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13919) | Researchers evaluated 19 language models on over 76,000 participants and discovered that specialized post-training methods increased persuasiveness by up to 51%, significantly more than gains from larger models alone. The top-performing approach involved prompting models to include dense factual content, but this led to a concerning downside: the most persuasive responses were also the most inaccurate.|

|[Runway Aleph Video Model.](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-aleph) | Runway's Aleph is a new in-context video model that can edit, transform, and generate videos with high accuracy, handling tasks such as object manipulation, changing camera angles, and adjusting style or lighting.|
|[Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507) | Alibaba's new open-source thinking model scores 92.3% on the AIME25 math benchmark, equaling OpenAI's O4-mini and outperforming it on coding tasks with 74.1% on LiveCodeBench. The 235B-parameter mixture-of-experts model only activates 22B parameters at a time, offering greater efficiency than standard dense models|
|[CollabLLM.](https://github.com/Wuyxin/collabllm) |CollabLLM is an open-source framework that teaches language models to ask strategic questions and steer conversations by using a "Multiturn-aware Reward" system, which judges responses based on their long-term effect on the dialogue rather than short-term helpfulness. |
|[AgenticSeek.](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek) | A fully local, voice-enabled AI assistant that autonomously browses the web, writes code, and plans tasks. It was designed to be a private open-source alternative to Manus AI with no cloud dependencies.|

|[Why China isn't about to leap ahead of the West on compute.](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/why-china-isnt-about-to-leap-ahead-of-the-west-on-compute) |Chinese hardware has narrowed the performance gap with NVIDIA's newest chips from 10x to about 3x, but over 90% of major Chinese language models since 2017 have still been trained using Western hardware. Low chip manufacturing yields—SMIC operates below 50% compared to TSMC’s 90%—and underdeveloped software ecosystems continue to push Chinese developers toward NVIDIA when they have access. |
