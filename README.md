|---|---|
|[Document Reranking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439v1) | LLM4Ranking is a recently introduced modular framework that works with both open and closed LLMs for document reranking, offering evaluation tools and reproducible benchmarks on well-known datasets.|
|[d1: Scaling Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12216) |The d1 framework enhances masked diffusion language models through a two-stage process: supervised fine-tuning on a small dataset followed by task-specific reinforcement learning using the novel diffu-GRPO method. This approach enables efficient gradient updates via random prompt masking, achieving strong performance gains on reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH500, outperforming similarly sized models while benefiting from longer outputs and faster convergence. |
|[Leveraging Reasoning Model Answers to Enhance Non-Reasoning Model Capability.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09639) |Researchers show that smaller models can gain strong reasoning abilities by being fine-tuned on final answers (and optionally summarized reasoning) from large LLMs. Using a curated 1.3M-instance dataset, they test different distillation strategies, finding that training on final answers alone boosts math/coding accuracy, while combining with summarized thoughts aids alignment tasks. Results highlight trade-offs in including reasoning traces and suggest future blending techniques for improved performance. |
|[Visual Reasoning with Less Data.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934v1) | Using MCTS to quantify sample difficulty, ThinkLite-VL improves reasoning in VLMs with just 11k training samples and no distillation|
|[Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2504.09858) | The paper introduces NoThinking, a prompting method that skips explicit reasoning steps yet matches or outperforms traditional chain-of-thought approaches in tasks like math, coding, and theorem proving. By jumping directly to answers with a dummy “Thinking” block, it achieves better accuracy–latency tradeoffs, excels in low-token settings, and benefits from parallel decoding, making it both faster and more efficient across multiple benchmarks.|
|[SocioVerse: A World Model for Social Simulation Powered by LLM Agents and A Pool of 10 Million Real-World Users.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10157) |SocioVerse, developed by Fudan University and collaborators, is a large-scale social simulation platform using LLM agents aligned with real-world data across environment, user demographics, interaction scenarios, and behavior. It achieves high accuracy in modeling elections, sentiment, and economic patterns, demonstrating the value of realistic user modeling. SocioVerse offers a scalable, flexible framework for testing sociopolitical hypotheses and bridging AI with social science. |
|[M1: Towards Scalable Test-Time Compute with Mamba Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10449) | M1 is a Mamba-based reasoning model trained with extended test-time computation, delivering solid performance—particularly on long-context tasks and throughput—though it doesn't quite reach state-of-the-art levels.|
|[Large Reasoning Models as a Judge.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00050) |JudgeLRM is a family of LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for judgment tasks. Unlike SFT, it excels in reasoning-heavy evaluations, outperforming models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1. |
|[Conversational AI for Cells.](https://blog.google/technology/research/cell2sentence-scale/) | C2S-Scale is a new family of LLMs that interprets single-cell data and translates biological signals into natural language for applications in personalized medicine and drug discovery.|
|[DocAgent: A Multi-Agent System for Automated Code Documentation Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08725) | Meta AI's DocAgent is a tool-integrated framework that generates high-quality docstrings for complex codebases using a team of specialized agents and a topological traversal strategy. By parsing code dependencies and incrementally building context, it avoids token overflow and improves documentation quality. Evaluated on Python projects, DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines in completeness, helpfulness, and truthfulness, with its dependency-aware Navigator proving essential to its success.|
