Called Google AI Edge Gallery, the app is available for Android and will soon come to iOS. It allows users to find, download, and run compatible models that generate images, answer questions, write and edit code, and more. The models run offline, without needing an internet connection, tapping into supported phones’ processors. |

|[Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally.](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek) |Mixture-of-Experts models with many layers, like DeepSeek, need large batch sizes and high latency to maintain throughput—otherwise, performance drops sharply. This is why DeepSeek isn’t ideal for personal use, as single-user, one-at-a-time inferences run very inefficiently. The article explores this issue in depth, explaining why some AI models respond slowly at first but speed up later, and how throughput, latency, and batch size impact performance. |
|[The Trackers and SDKs in ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Perplexity.](https://jamesoclaire.com/2025/05/31/the-trackers-and-sdks-in-chatgpt-claude-grok-and-perplexity/) |This post examines the third-party SDKs and API calls used in the four major Android AI chat apps: ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Perplexity. It analyzes each app's development tools, business and marketing analytics, monetization methods, and the API activity observed while the apps are running. |
|[Bond Capital Releases Comprehensive 340-Slide Report on AI Trends.](https://www.bondcap.com/report/pdf/Trends_Artificial_Intelligence.pdf) |VC Mary Meeker’s analysis highlights the rapid adoption of AI, noting that ChatGPT reached global scale in just three years, compared to 23 years for the internet. The report shows AI chatbots are now mistaken for humans 73% of the time, up from 50% six months ago, inference costs have dropped by 99% since 2022, and enterprise use has moved beyond experimentation into broader deployment. |
|[Zero-Shot Visual Understanding.](https://github.com/avaxiao/TextRegion) | TextRegion creates text-aligned region tokens by combining frozen image-text models with segmentation masks from SAM2, allowing zero-shot performance on complex visual understanding tasks without the need for training. |

|[Differential Privacy on Trust Graphs.](https://research.google/blog/differential-privacy-on-trust-graphs/) | A study introduces a privacy framework that incorporates varying trust levels among users into differential privacy models, offering a more realistic approach to data sharing preferences than traditional binary trust assumptions.|
|[Do You Even Have a System Prompt?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HjHqxzn3rnH7T45hp/do-you-even-have-a-system-prompt-psa-repo) |Most users overlook system prompts or use brief, unoptimized ones, missing out on major improvements in AI behavior. Instead of reacting to poor outputs in isolated chats, users should iteratively test and refine their system prompts. The post’s comment section features a collection of system prompts shared by the community. |
