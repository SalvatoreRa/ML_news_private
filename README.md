|[Kimi 1.5: Scaling RL with LLMs.](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5/blob/main/Kimi_k1.5.pdf) | Kimi has unveiled k1.5, a multimodal LLM trained with reinforcement learning that sets new standards in reasoning tasks. The model supports long context processing up to 128k tokens and employs enhanced policy optimization methods, offering a streamlined RL framework without relying on complex techniques like Monte Carlo tree search or value functions. Impressively, k1.5 matches OpenAI's o1 performance on key benchmarks, scoring 77.5 on AIME and 96.2 on MATH 500. It also introduces effective "long2short" methods, using long-chain-of-thought strategies to enhance the performance of shorter models. This approach allows k1.5's short-chain-of-thought version to significantly outperform models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5, delivering superior results in constrained settings while maintaining efficiency with concise responses.|
|[Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LuCLf4BJsr) | A new framework has been developed for tackling long-context tasks by utilizing multiple LLM agents working collaboratively. Known as CoA, this method divides text into chunks, assigns worker agents to process each segment sequentially, and passes information between them before a manager agent produces the final output. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods such as input reduction or extended context windows. Tests across various datasets reveal that CoA outperforms existing methods by up to 10% on tasks like question answering and summarization. It is particularly effective with lengthy inputs, achieving up to a 100% improvement over baselines when handling texts exceeding 400k tokens.|

|[Humanity’s Last Exam.](https://static.scale.com/uploads/654197dc94d34f66c0f5184e/Publication%20Ready%20Humanity's%20Last%20Exam.pdf) | Humanity's Last Exam is a new multi-modal benchmark designed to push the boundaries of large language models (LLMs). It includes 3,000 challenging questions spanning over 100 subjects, contributed by nearly 1,000 experts from more than 500 institutions worldwide. Current leading AI models struggle with this benchmark, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving the highest accuracy at just 9.4%, highlighting substantial gaps in AI performance. Intended to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark, it addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks like MMLU, which have become too easy as models now exceed 90% accuracy. Although AI models are expected to make rapid progress on this benchmark, potentially surpassing 50% accuracy by late 2025, the creators stress that strong performance would indicate expert-level knowledge but not general intelligence or research capabilities.|
