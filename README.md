|[Self-Explainable AI.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16693v1) |In the field of explainable AI, there is a strong focus on developing self-explainable models, which offer a more principled approach compared to post-hoc methods that attempt to interpret decisions after they have been made by opaque models. Despite its potential, this line of research often faces challenges such as lack of reproducibility, difficulties in comparison, and inconsistent standards. To address these issues, we introduce CaBRNet, an open-source, modular, and backward-compatible framework for Case-Based Reasoning Networks |
