|[How much do language models memorize?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832) |Researchers created a method to distinguish true memorization from generalization by training models on random data, where generalization can’t occur, and comparing it to real text. They found that models first memorize data until hitting their capacity, then begin learning broader patterns. GPT-style transformers store about 3.6 bits of information per parameter, which helps explain why extracting specific training data from modern LLMs usually fails—the datasets are far larger than what the models can memorize. |

|[Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally.](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek) |Mixture-of-Experts models with many layers, like DeepSeek, need large batch sizes and high latency to maintain throughput—otherwise, performance drops sharply. This is why DeepSeek isn’t ideal for personal use, as single-user, one-at-a-time inferences run very inefficiently. The article explores this issue in depth, explaining why some AI models respond slowly at first but speed up later, and how throughput, latency, and batch size impact performance. |
|[The Trackers and SDKs in ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Perplexity.](https://jamesoclaire.com/2025/05/31/the-trackers-and-sdks-in-chatgpt-claude-grok-and-perplexity/) |This post examines the third-party SDKs and API calls used in the four major Android AI chat apps: ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Perplexity.

Their live tests found that GPT-4.1 achieved the same conversion rate as Claude 3.5 Sonnet but at a lower cost, highlighting that “good enough” models can offer better value than top benchmark performers. The guide includes Python code for statistical testing and cautions against issues like p-hacking and checking results too early.|

|[Why Do AGI Timelines Vary So Widely?](https://bluedot.org/blog/agi-timelines) |Many AI lab CEOs estimate AGI could arrive in 2–5 years, citing rapid progress such as saturated benchmarks, AI task completion doubling every seven months, and the prospect of AI automating its own research to spark an intelligence explosion. In contrast, external experts often predict AGI is decades away—or unachievable with current methods—arguing that benchmarks focus on well-defined tasks, that Moravec's Paradox shows we've tackled the easier cognitive challenges first, and that intelligence alone doesn't guarantee scientific discovery. |
