|[DeepSeek-R2.](https://deepseek.ai/blog/deepseek-r2-ai-model-launch-2025) | DeepSeek has launched DeepSeek-R2, a multilingual and resource-efficient model positioned to challenge global AI leaders.|
|[Musk’s xAI Holdings is reportedly raising the second-largest private funding round ever.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/musks-xai-holdings-is-reportedly-raising-the-second-largest-private-funding-round-ever/) | Elon Musk’s xAI Holdings is in talks to raise $20 billion in fresh funding, potentially valuing the AI and social media combo at over $120 billion, according to a new Bloomberg report that says talks are in the “early stages.” If successful, the deal would be the second-largest startup funding round ever, behind only OpenAI’s $40 billion raise last month.|

|[Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21233) |Microsoft's Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning is a 3.8B parameter model that delivers state-of-the-art math reasoning, outperforming larger models on MATH-500. Trained via a four-stage pipeline—mid-training, fine-tuning, DPO, and RL with verifiable rewards—it combines efficiency with accuracy. Using 10M filtered CoT samples and tailored RL strategies, it shows that small models can achieve high reasoning performance when guided by carefully structured training. |
|[Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413) |This paper introduces Mem0 and Mem0g, memory-centric architectures that help LLM agents maintain coherence across long conversations by overcoming fixed-context limits. Mem0 uses dense language-based memory with efficient updates, while Mem0g adds a graph-based structure for better relational and temporal reasoning. Both outperform existing memory and RAG systems on LOCOMO benchmarks, with Mem0g leading in accuracy and Mem0 excelling in latency—making them ideal for real-time, long-term agent use. |
