|[Large Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662) |Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed human persuaders in a controlled study, achieving a 7.6% higher success rate in influencing participants' quiz responses. It was more effective at steering users toward both correct answers (+12.2%) and incorrect ones (-15.1%). |
|[Robustness of LLM-based Safety Judges.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04474) | The study reveals weaknesses in LLM-based safety judges, demonstrating that their assessments can be heavily influenced by prompt variations and adversarial attacks.|
|[Introducing the AI Gateway.](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-gateway) |Vercel has launched an AI Gateway for alpha testing, enabling easy switching between ~100 AI models without managing API keys or accounts. |
|[Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400) | [FutureHouse](https://www.futurehouse.org/research-announcements/demonstrating-end-to-end-scientific-discovery-with-robin-a-multi-agent-system) used a continuous experimental loop combining literature search agents and a data analysis agent to speed up medical discovery. The system autonomously forms hypotheses from literature, suggests experiments for humans to carry out, and then analyzes the results to guide further research. This approach led to the identification of ripasudil, an eye drop that reduces cellular tension, as a potential treatment for age-related vision loss caused by the gradual decline of retinal light-sensitive cells. All code, data, and agent interaction logs will be publicly released on May 27.|

They perform well when tasks are narrowly defined, but their effectiveness drops when required to juggle abstract aesthetic choices with precise visual adjustments. This highlights a gap in connecting symbolic reasoning with spatial grounding, particularly in tasks that require detailed, step-by-step image modifications.|
|[LLM function calls don't scale; code orchestration is simpler, more effective.](https://jngiam.bearblog.dev/mcp-large-data/) |Providing large language models with complete tool outputs is expensive and inefficient. Output schemas let developers retrieve structured data for easier processing. Using code execution to handle data from MCP tools helps scale AI capabilities, but granting the execution environment access to MCPs, tools, and user data demands careful planning around API key management and tool exposure. |
