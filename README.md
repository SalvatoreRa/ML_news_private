|[Baba is Eval.](https://fi-le.net/baba/) | *Baba is You* is a puzzle game that challenges players to manipulate rules to solve levels, requiring a high level of abstract reasoning. This study examines how large language models perform in the game. Currently, Claude 4 struggles with it, suggesting that a model focused on reasoning might be more suitable. The next phase of the study may involve evaluating such models.|
|[CoRT (Chain of Recursive Thoughts).](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts) | CoRT boosts AI performance by enabling models to self-evaluate and iteratively generate alternative responses to find the best one. When tested with Mistral 3.1 24B, it led to notable gains in programming tasks. This approach refines outputs through repeated generation and selection, resulting in more accurate and effective responses.|

Nikkei Asia reports that when examining English-language preprint papers available on the website arXiv, it found 17 papers that included some form of hidden AI prompt. The paper’s authors were affiliated with 14 academic institutions in eight countries, including Japan’s Waseda University and South Korea’s KAIST, as well as Columbia University and the University of Washington in the United States.|

|[The American DeepSeek Project.](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-american-deepseek-project) |Meta's recent AI struggles have left a gap in the open-source AI landscape, now mostly occupied by Chinese models. If this trend persists, the AI field could divide into two camps: high-performing but costly closed-source models from the U.S., and affordable, widespread, yet possibly insecure models from China. The U.S. likely has a narrow window—around two years—to reverse this by investing \$100–500 million in an open-source model that rivals the best proprietary ones. |
|[What can agents actually do?](https://lethain.com/what-can-agents-do/) |While there's plenty of hype around AI, much of the discussion is so abstract it becomes unhelpful. This post aims to clearly explain how AI agents function, using a few real-world examples. AI agents can significantly enhance software quality and system design—but if the underlying systems are flawed, agents can actually make things worse. |
|[Why I don't think AGI is right around the corner.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) |Getting LLMs to perform consistent, humanlike work is difficult because they’re missing key capabilities. One major issue is their inability to improve over time—without continual learning, they stay fixed at their initial skill level. There's also no effective way to give them nuanced, human-style feedback. Tweaking system prompts falls far short of the kind of learning humans go through. Unlike people, LLMs can’t build context over time, reflect on their mistakes, or gradually refine their performance through practice. |
|[A Review of Alpha School, the private school with 2-hour days and AI teachers.](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school) |A year-long investigation by a parent revealed that the \$40,000 Austin school operates with 3.5-hour school days, a 5:1 student-teacher ratio, and strong incentive systems—contrary to its marketing as an AI-driven, teacher-free model. While students progress through material 2.6 times faster using personalized learning tools, parents argue the real benefit isn't acceleration, but time: the model could give children around nine extra years outside the classroom to explore their own interests. |
|[The ‘ChatGPT Moment’ in Robotics and beyond.](https://paritoshmohan.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-moment-in-robotics-and) | Just three years ago, reliable robotic object manipulation demanded large engineering teams. Today, a college student can fine-tune an open-source vision-language-action model over a weekend and achieve results that once took months. This article explores what a "ChatGPT moment" for robotics might look like, surveys the current landscape, highlights emerging technologies, and predicts likely leaders. While the presence of robots in daily life may initially feel surreal, they'll soon become as essential and commonplace as AI assistants are today.|
