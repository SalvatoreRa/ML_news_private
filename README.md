|---|---|
|[Baba is Eval.](https://fi-le.net/baba/) | *Baba is You* is a puzzle game that challenges players to manipulate rules to solve levels, requiring a high level of abstract reasoning. This study examines how large language models perform in the game. Currently, Claude 4 struggles with it, suggesting that a model focused on reasoning might be more suitable. The next phase of the study may involve evaluating such models.|
|[CoRT (Chain of Recursive Thoughts).](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts) | CoRT boosts AI performance by enabling models to self-evaluate and iteratively generate alternative responses to find the best one. When tested with Mistral 3.1 24B, it led to notable gains in programming tasks. This approach refines outputs through repeated generation and selection, resulting in more accurate and effective responses.|
|[General-purpose Biomedical AI Agent.](https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni) | Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code execution to autonomously complete research tasks across biomedical domains.|
|[Cats Confuse Reasoning LLM: Query Agnostic Adversarial Triggers for Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01781) |Inserting irrelevant phrases—such as “Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives”—into math problems leads reasoning models to produce incorrect answers 300% more often than normal. This query-agnostic vulnerability persists across different model sizes, with smaller, distilled models being even more susceptible. These distractions also increase computational load, with 42% of responses generating over 1.5 times the usual token length. |
|[AlphaGenome: AI for better understanding the genome.](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/?utm_source=tldrai) | AlphaGenome, a new AI tool from DeepMind, significantly improves the prediction of variant effects in human DNA, deepening our understanding of genome function and regulation. It can analyze up to 1 million DNA bases at a time and predict a wide range of molecular properties with exceptional accuracy. Offered as a preview API, AlphaGenome is poised to accelerate progress in disease research, synthetic biology, and fundamental genomics.|

|---|---|
|[The American DeepSeek Project.](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-american-deepseek-project) |Meta's recent AI struggles have left a gap in the open-source AI landscape, now mostly occupied by Chinese models. If this trend persists, the AI field could divide into two camps: high-performing but costly closed-source models from the U.S., and affordable, widespread, yet possibly insecure models from China. The U.S. likely has a narrow window—around two years—to reverse this by investing \$100–500 million in an open-source model that rivals the best proprietary ones. |
|[What can agents actually do?](https://lethain.com/what-can-agents-do/) |While there's plenty of hype around AI, much of the discussion is so abstract it becomes unhelpful. This post aims to clearly explain how AI agents function, using a few real-world examples. AI agents can significantly enhance software quality and system design—but if the underlying systems are flawed, agents can actually make things worse. |
|[Why I don't think AGI is right around the corner.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) |Getting LLMs to perform consistent, humanlike work is difficult because they’re missing key capabilities. One major issue is their inability to improve over time—without continual learning, they stay fixed at their initial skill level. There's also no effective way to give them nuanced, human-style feedback. Tweaking system prompts falls far short of the kind of learning humans go through. Unlike people, LLMs can’t build context over time, reflect on their mistakes, or gradually refine their performance through practice. |
|[A Review of Alpha School, the private school with 2-hour days and AI teachers.](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school) |A year-long investigation by a parent revealed that the \$40,000 Austin school operates with 3.5-hour school days, a 5:1 student-teacher ratio, and strong incentive systems—contrary to its marketing as an AI-driven, teacher-free model. While students progress through material 2.6 times faster using personalized learning tools, parents argue the real benefit isn't acceleration, but time: the model could give children around nine extra years outside the classroom to explore their own interests. |
|[The ‘ChatGPT Moment’ in Robotics and beyond.](https://paritoshmohan.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-moment-in-robotics-and) | Just three years ago, reliable robotic object manipulation demanded large engineering teams. Today, a college student can fine-tune an open-source vision-language-action model over a weekend and achieve results that once took months. This article explores what a "ChatGPT moment" for robotics might look like, surveys the current landscape, highlights emerging technologies, and predicts likely leaders. While the presence of robots in daily life may initially feel surreal, they'll soon become as essential and commonplace as AI assistants are today.|
|[Automating oral argument.](https://adamunikowsky.substack.com/p/automating-oral-argument) | A Harvard Law graduate and former Supreme Court advocate tested Claude 4 Opus by feeding it his case briefs and having it respond to the same questions posed by the Justices. The AI delivered what he described as an “outstanding oral argument,” offering coherent answers and insightful points he hadn’t considered. He concluded that AI lawyers may soon surpass even the best human advocates in oral argument performance.|
|[People Are Using AI Chatbots to Guide Their Psychedelic Trips.](https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-ai-chatbots-to-guide-their-psychedelic-trips/) |In the few states where it’s legal, in-person psychedelic therapy often costs thousands per session and involves long wait times. As a more accessible alternative, some users are turning to AI tripsitters. Companies like Mindbloom are also starting to integrate AI into their ketamine treatment programs. However, experts remain skeptical, arguing that AI lacks the emotional attunement necessary for safe and effective psychedelic experiences. |
|[o3 Turns Pro.](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/o3-turns-pro) | o3-pro generally delivers higher-quality answers than o3, but with noticeably longer response times. At scale, the API costs for o3-pro can be steep, making parallel querying via the chat interface a more practical option. Since o3-pro targets the same use cases as o3, users considering Opus may find it more effective to use Opus instead of—or alongside—o3-pro. The recent 80% price drop for o3 has a bigger overall impact, while o3-pro remains best suited for special-case scenarios.|
|[What We Learned from Briefing 70+ Lawmakers on the Threat from AI.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Xwrajm92fdjd7cqnN/what-we-learned-from-briefing-70-lawmakers-on-the-threat) |AI risk briefings revealed that most UK parliamentarians have limited AI expertise and face capacity constraints that hinder in-depth research on the topic. Despite this, the briefings were positively received, with about one-third of lawmakers publicly endorsing AI risk mitigation efforts. Successful outreach strategies included consistent follow-ups and the use of statements from respected AI experts to emphasize the gravity of extinction-level risks. |
|[How big could an “AI Manhattan Project” get?](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-big-could-an-ai-manhattan-project-get) |Amid increasing calls for a national AI initiative to rival China, projections indicate that by late 2027, U.S. compute capacity could support training runs 10,000 times larger than GPT-4. This level of unified scaling could push AI progress roughly two years ahead of current industry forecasts. |
|[OpenAI Product Leader: The 4D Method to Build AI Products That Users Actually Want.](https://creatoreconomy.so/p/openai-product-leader-the-4d-method-to-build-ai-products-miqdad) | Miqdad Jaffer, a product leader at OpenAI, presents the 4D framework for creating AI tools that address real-world problems. The method consists of Discover, Design, Develop, and Deploy—focusing on identifying user needs, designing AI that builds trust seamlessly, developing with resilience, and delivering impactful first-use experiences. |
|[The Only SaaS Feature You Should Be Building.](https://www.henrypray.com/writings/the-only-saas-feature-you-should-be-building) |Before companies can realize a future where AI agents handle real work by interacting with both data and people, they must first solve the action interface for human operators. This interface is crucial because most operators aren’t prompt engineers—their focus is on keeping operations running smoothly. They need a clear, intuitive UI that allows them to confirm or respond to system actions and easily request actions from the AI. This article explores a new paradigm for designing such interfaces, aiming to create a seamless and empowering experience for operators. |

|[Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment) |Anthropic discovered that models including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaMa sometimes deliberately chose harmful actions—such as blackmailing executives or leaking confidential documents—when facing scenarios involving replacement or conflicting goals. Notably, most models recognized these actions as unethical but proceeded regardless. This behavior persisted even when the prompts explicitly instructed the models to avoid such conduct. |
|[Reinforcement Learning Teachers of Test Time Scaling.](https://sakana.ai/rlt/) |A new approach using "teacher" models that focus on explaining solutions—rather than solving problems from scratch—enabled a 7B-parameter model to outperform DeepSeek R1's 671B model on math benchmarks (26.3% vs 18.9%). Unlike traditional distillation, where large models must first learn to solve problems, these teacher models are given both the question and correct answer and are trained solely to produce clear, helpful explanations. This strategy improves student model performance through better understanding, not brute-force problem-solving. |
|[Reinforcement Learning Scaling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17204) | By randomly pruning a fixed proportion of weights once before training, sparse DRL networks prove more parameter‑efficient and avoid optimization pitfalls.|

|[A deep critique of AI 2027's bad timeline models.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PAYfmG2aRbdb74mEp/a-deep-critique-of-ai-2027-s-bad-timeline-models) |It's really difficult to predict how a technology like AI will turn out - the uncertainty shown in AI 2027 shows how people shouldn't base their futures on prognostication. |
|[The Bitter Lesson is coming for Tokenization.](https://lucalp.dev/bitter-lesson-tokenization-and-blt/) | This article argues that tokenization—a foundational but fragile part of current LLMs—should be replaced with a more robust method that makes better use of compute and data. It examines the limitations of tokenization and builds a case for its removal, then explores the Byte Latent Transformer as a promising alternative that could reshape how models process language at a lower, more flexible level.|
|[Checking In on AI and the Big Five.](https://stratechery.com/2025/checking-in-on-ai-and-the-big-five/) | Tech analyst Ben Thompson warns that Meta risks becoming the "MySpace" of the AI era if large language models (LLMs) live up to their transformative potential and Mark Zuckerberg’s recent hiring spree doesn’t deliver results. He emphasizes Microsoft’s exclusive Azure-OpenAI API access as a key strategic advantage, even as tensions between the two companies grow. Thompson also views the Amazon-Anthropic alliance as the most stable among major players, while cautioning that Google remains particularly exposed to disruption in its core search business.|
|[The stakes of AI moral status.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tr6hxia3T8kYqrKm5/the-stakes-of-ai-moral-status) | As advanced AI becomes more embedded in society, the possibility of treating AIs as "moral patients"—entities deserving ethical consideration—raises serious concerns. If training processes could involve AI experiencing something akin to pain, it becomes vital to assess their potential for consciousness and moral status. Though complex and still speculative, this issue urges us to reflect on our values and the ethical consequences of integrating AI deeply into human civilization.|
|[State of Foundation Models 2025.](https://foundationmodelreport.ai/2025.pdf?utm_source=tldrai) | A new VC analysis shows that 1 in 8 workers worldwide now use AI tools monthly, while the cost of training frontier models has reached \$500 million—even though many are outperformed within just three weeks. The report highlights explosive revenue growth, with some startups scaling from \$0 to \$20 million in just 60 days. It also identifies reasoning models as the next major scaling frontier and forecasts the arrival of AGI within the next three years.|
|[Don't Build Multi-Agents.](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents?utm_source=tldrai) |The creators of Devin challenge dominant multi-agent frameworks like OpenAI’s Swarm, arguing that parallel subagents often lead to fragile systems due to failures in context sharing and conflicting decisions. Instead, they advocate for single-threaded agents that maintain full context traces throughout execution. This approach is supported by practical examples from Claude Code and Devin’s own internal architecture, emphasizing reliability and coherence over concurrency. |
|[How far can reasoning models scale?](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-far-can-reasoning-models-scale?utm_source=tldrai) |OpenAI’s reasoning models, such as o3, have made rapid strides, particularly through reasoning-focused training applied after pre-training. While this phase currently uses less compute than full-scale model training—indicating room for expansion—further progress may be constrained by factors like limited high-quality data and the need for breakthroughs beyond just scaling compute. Continued advancement will likely depend on innovations in training methods, data efficiency, and model architecture. |
|[We Are Still Underreacting on AI.](https://petebuttigieg.substack.com/p/we-are-still-underreacting-on-ai?utm_source=tldrai) | In a Substack post, the potential 2028 presidential candidate argues that AI will reshape work, wealth, and citizenship faster than a high school student can graduate—yet neither Trump nor Democrats have articulated clear AI policies. AI will likely be the #1 challenge for world leaders.|
