# ML news: 

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[OpenAI and MIT Exploring AI and Emotional Well-Being.](https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/) | MIT Media Lab and OpenAI are studying how users emotionally engage with ChatGPT, focusing on its effects on social and emotional well-being. The research highlights the varied ways people interact with AI conversational models and lays the groundwork for future studies on responsible AI use.|
|[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551) |This paper introduces a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) to tackle reward hacking and error propagation in fine-grained LLM reasoning. HRM evaluates multiple steps, improving self-correction and providing more reliable assessments than traditional Process Reward Models (PRM), which can penalize corrections. HRM’s multi-step feedback framework also mitigates reward hacking by discouraging short-sighted strategies. The paper also presents Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which reduces the computational cost of generating annotations with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) while increasing dataset diversity. Experiments show that HRM outperforms standard models on complex tasks, providing better accuracy and more stable solutions. |
|[Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/latent-multi-hop-reasoning) |This research examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) perform multi-hop reasoning by connecting multiple knowledge pieces in response to complex prompts. The study found evidence of this reasoning, especially in the initial step, with the use of connected knowledge varying and scaling with model size, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for future LLM development. |
|[DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476) |DAPO is an open-source, large-scale RL system that enhances LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning. It improves PPO-style training by raising the upper clipping threshold to prevent entropy collapse, encouraging more diverse token exploration. DAPO filters out always-correct or always-wrong samples, speeding up convergence by focusing on prompts with useful gradient signals. It applies policy gradients per token instead of averaging losses, ensuring high-quality, appropriately lengthy outputs. The system also prevents excessive verbosity by penalizing long answers. DAPO achieves state-of-the-art math performance on the AIME 2024 test set, outperforming DeepSeek’s R1 with less training time. |
|[Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10061) |Researchers from the University of Wisconsin and Meta AI explore how different skills, like knowledge-based QA and code generation, show distinct scaling behaviors in LLMs. They found that the optimal trade-off between model size and data volume varies by skill, with knowledge tasks being "capacity-hungry" and code tasks being "data-hungry." Even after adjusting data mixes, knowledge-based QA still requires larger models, while code tasks benefit from more data. Choosing the right validation set is crucial, as incorrect sets can mislead model scaling by up to 50%. Developers must design validation sets that align with the final skill mix to optimize performance. |
|[Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15893v2) |UniHDSA is a unified relation prediction approach for hierarchical document structure analysis, enabling a single module to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. |
