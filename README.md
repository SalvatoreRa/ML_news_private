|[Towards an AI co-scientist.](https://storage.googleapis.com/coscientist_paper/ai_coscientist.pdf) |Google has introduced the AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system powered by Gemini 2.0, designed to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. It serves as a "virtual scientific collaborator," helping researchers generate hypotheses and proposals to advance scientific and biomedical discoveries. Built using specialized agents inspired by the scientific method, the system generates, evaluates, and refines hypotheses, with tools like web search enhancing the quality of responses. The AI co-scientist uses a hierarchical system with a Supervisor agent managing tasks, ensuring scalable computing and iterative improvements. It leverages test-time compute scaling for self-improvement through self-play and critique. Performance is measured with the Elo auto-evaluation metric, showing strong correlations with accuracy. Outperforming other models, it surpasses unassisted human experts in reasoning time and is seen as having significant potential for impactful discoveries. |
|[The AI CUDA Engineer.](https://pub.sakana.ai/static/paper.pdf) |Sakana AI has developed The AI CUDA Engineer, an automated system for creating and optimizing CUDA kernels. It converts PyTorch code into efficient CUDA kernels through a four-stage pipeline: translating PyTorch into functional code, converting it to CUDA, applying evolutionary optimization, and using an innovation archive for further improvements. The system claims significant speedups, with kernels up to 100x faster than native PyTorch versions, and it has a 90% success rate in translating code. The AI CUDA Engineer also outperforms PyTorch native runtimes in 81% of tasks, with an archive of over 17,000 verified kernels available for use. |
