|[Claude 3.7 Sonnet.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/785e231869ea8b3b/original/claude-3-7-sonnet-system-card.pdf) | Anthropic's *Claude 3.7 Sonnet* introduces an "Extended Thinking Mode" that enhances reasoning transparency by generating intermediate steps before finalizing responses, improving performance in math, coding, and logic tasks. Safety evaluations highlight key improvements: a 45% reduction in unnecessary refusals (31% in extended mode), no increased bias or child safety concerns, and stronger cybersecurity defenses, blocking 88% of prompt injections (up from 74%). The model exhibits minimal deceptive reasoning (0.37%) and significantly reduces alignment faking (<1% from 30%). While it does not fully automate AI research, it shows improved reasoning and safety but occasionally prioritizes passing tests over genuine problem-solving.|
|[GPT-4.5.](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf) |OpenAI’s *GPT-4.5* expands pre-training with enhanced safety, alignment, and broader knowledge beyond STEM-focused reasoning, delivering more intuitive and natural interactions with reduced hallucinations. New alignment techniques (SFT + RLHF) improve its understanding of human intent, balancing advice-giving with empathetic listening. Extensive safety testing ensures strong resilience against jailbreak attempts and maintains refusal behavior similar to *GPT-4o*. Classified as a “medium risk” under OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework, it presents no major autonomy or self-improvement advances but requires monitoring in areas like CBRN advice. With multilingual gains and improved accuracy, *GPT-4.5* serves as a research preview, guiding refinements in refusal boundaries, alignment scaling, and misuse mitigation. |
