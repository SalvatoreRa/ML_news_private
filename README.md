|[Transformer2 : Self-adaptive LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252) |Transformer² is a self-adaptation framework designed to adapt LLMs to unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting specific components of their weight matrices. It operates through two main phases: 1) A dispatch system analyzes and identifies properties of the incoming task. 2) Task-specific behaviors are generated by combining "expert" vectors trained through reinforcement learning. The framework claims to be more efficient than LoRA, requiring fewer parameters, and is compatible with various LLM architectures. |
|[MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08313) |This series introduces new models incorporating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), featuring a model with 32 experts and 456 billion parameters, with 45.9 billion activated per token. The models claim to match the performance of state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4o and |
|[VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05874) | VideoRAG is a framework that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating video content as an external knowledge source. Unlike traditional RAG methods focused on text or images, VideoRAG dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on queries and integrates both visual and textual elements into the generation process. It employs Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to directly process video content, capturing temporal dynamics, spatial details, and multimodal cues that static modalities often miss. For videos without textual descriptions, automatic speech recognition is used to generate transcripts, enabling the utilization of both visual and textual modalities effectively.|
|[Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) |This approach introduces a neural long-term memory module to retain historical context, allowing attention mechanisms to focus on the current context while leveraging long-past information. The module provides a more persistent memory compared to attention alone, which is considered more short-term. Titan, a model built on this neural memory concept, demonstrates strong performance across language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks. |
|[OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751) |OmniThink is a new framework designed to emulate a human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection, simulating the cognitive behavior of learners as they deepen their understanding. Unlike RAG or role-playing methods, OmniThink continuously reflects and explores to expand knowledge boundaries, making it particularly well-suited for use cases requiring long-form content generation. |
|[AutoCBT: An Autonomous Multi-agent Framework for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Psychological Counseling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09426) |AutoCBT is a multi-agent framework designed for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), capable of generating high-quality responses for single-turn psychological consultation scenarios. It employs dynamic routing, memory, and supervisory mechanisms to enhance the autonomy of each agent. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoCBT delivers superior automated psychological counseling services, outperforming other purely prompt-based frameworks in dialogue quality. |
|[Imagine while Reasoning in Space: Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07542) | MVoT (Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought) is an innovative reasoning framework that allows AI models to reason using both text and images. By enhancing traditional Chain-of-Thought prompting, MVoT enables models to generate visual representations of their reasoning steps alongside textual explanations. Implemented in the multimodal language model Chameleon-7B, MVoT incorporates a "token discrepancy loss" to improve the quality of visualizations. The framework outperforms traditional methods, excelling in complex scenarios and achieving over 90% accuracy on tasks such as maze navigation and printer installation.|
|[ChemAgent: Self-updating Library in Large Language Models Improves Chemical Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06590) |This framework enhances LLM performance in chemical reasoning through a dynamic, self-updating library. It works by decomposing chemical tasks into sub-tasks and organizing them into a structured, reusable collection for future queries. When presented with a new problem, the system retrieves and refines relevant library information to improve task decomposition. The library is continuously updated with new sub-tasks and solutions as they are validated. Experiments on SciBench show that ChemAgent achieves up to a 46% performance improvement (GPT-4), significantly surpassing existing approaches. |

|[Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09891) |Unlike the straightforward R1 approach, DeepMind's work employs an evolutionary strategy, where a language model guides the modification and generation of new responses. This method enhances reasoning capabilities, particularly in planning tasks that involve an element of exploration. |

|[Google Researchers Can Create an AI That Thinks a Lot Like You After Just a Two-Hour Interview.](https://gizmodo.com/google-researchers-can-create-an-ai-that-thinks-a-lot-like-you-after-just-a-two-hour-interview-2000547704) | Stanford researchers, in collaboration with Google DeepMind, developed AI agents that mimic human behavior with 85% accuracy by interviewing 1,052 individuals through a custom interface. These agents aim to assist decision-makers in gauging public opinions by simulating reactions to policies and product launches. Although the agents performed strongly on personality tests, they faced challenges in accurately replicating human decisions in economic games.|

|[Harnessing AI to respond to the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069695) |AMR-Policy GPT is an AI tool leveraging large language models to support antimicrobial resistance policy creation in 146 countries. It helps policymakers access context-specific insights, enhancing National Action Plans, particularly in areas with limited local data or infrastructure. The initiative is co-led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Durham University. |

Meanwhile, Meta is moving away from professional fact-checkers, transferring the responsibility to users, a shift that has raised concerns among former collaborators. Additionally, MIT Technology Review has identified emerging stem-cell therapies as one of the top ten breakthrough technologies for 2025.|
