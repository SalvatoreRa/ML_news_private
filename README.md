|[The Leaderboard Illusion.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879) |The Leaderboard Illusion reveals major flaws in the Chatbot Arena ranking system, showing that practices like selective score reporting, extreme data imbalances, silent model removals, and overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics distort LLM comparisons. Through analysis of 2M battles, the paper finds that private testing privileges and data access for proprietary models inflate scores and undermine fairness, making the leaderboard an unreliable measure of real-world model quality. |

|[Meta taps former Google DeepMind director to lead its AI research lab.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/meta-taps-former-google-deepmind-director-to-lead-its-ai-research-lab/) | Meta has named Robert Fergus, former research director at DeepMind, as the new head of its FAIR lab following a stretch of leadership shifts and staff exits.|
|[Microsoft and OpenAI may be renegotiating their partnership.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/11/microsoft-and-openai-may-be-renegotiating-their-partnership/) | OpenAI and Microsoft are revisiting their multibillion-dollar partnership in a pivotal deal that may shape OpenAI's future. Microsoft, having invested more than \$13 billion, is proposing to trade part of its equity for extended access to OpenAI's technology beyond their current agreement, which ends in 2030.| 
|[Deep Research now supports GitHub repo analysis in ChatGPT.](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1920556386083102844) | ChatGPT's Deep Research agent now supports scanning GitHub repositories, analyzing source code and pull requests to generate detailed, cited reports. Users can directly query repositories via the Deep Research → GitHub integration.|
|[Open Source Project Curl Battles Wave of AI-Generated False Vulnerabilities.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/open-source-project-curl-is-sick-of-users-submitting-ai-slop-vulnerabilities/) |curl project founder Daniel Stenberg has grown frustrated with the surge of AI-generated false vulnerability reports submitted via platforms like HackerOne. Although HackerOne argues that AI can improve report quality if used properly, Stenberg is calling for better infrastructure and tools to address what he sees as a denial-of-service attack on maintainers' time and focus. |

|[Llama-Nemotron: Efficient Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00949v2) |NVIDIA’s Llama-Nemotron series—LN-Nano (8B), LN-Super (49B), and LN-Ultra (253B)—introduces powerful, open reasoning models that rival or surpass DeepSeek-R1 while offering better efficiency. Key innovations include a dynamic reasoning toggle for inference-time control and a multi-stage training pipeline combining architecture search, distillation, and RL. LN-Ultra leads on reasoning benchmarks and chat alignment, with open weights, code, and data released to support open research. |
|[Optimizing GEMM with Thread Block Clusters.](https://research.colfax-intl.com/cutlass-tutorial-gemm-with-thread-block-clusters-on-nvidia-blackwell-gpus/) |Thread block clusters and 2-SM UMMA instructions on Blackwell GPUs enable higher arithmetic intensity and more efficient memory transfers in GEMM workloads using CUTLASS. |
|[Meta AssetGen 2.0.](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/AssetGen2) | Meta's AssetGen 2.0 introduces updated diffusion-based models for creating detailed 3D meshes and textures from text and image prompts, offering improved consistency, accuracy, and view-aware texture resolution compared to the earlier version.|
|[Flow-GRPO for RL-Tuned Diffusion Models.](https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo) |Flow-GRPO integrates reinforcement learning into flow matching by converting ODEs into SDEs and using denoising reduction to enhance sample efficiency and alignment. |

|[Australia has been hesitant – but could robots soon be delivering your pizza?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/11/australia-has-been-hesitant-but-could-robots-soon-be-delivering-your-pizza) | While there have been concerns over the safety and legal status of the technology, working models from local startups are showing its benefits|
|[For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/for-silicon-valley-ai-isnt-just-about-replacing-some-jobs-its-about-replacing-all-of-them) |AI will do the thinking, robots will do the doing. What place do humans have in this arrangement – and do tech CEOs care? |
|[What's the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT?](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/carbon-footprint-chatgpt) |ChatGPT queries use much less energy than previously thought, with new estimates putting typical usage at just 0.3 Wh—ten times lower than earlier figures. Although AI’s total energy use is worth monitoring, individual text-based interactions have a minimal environmental impact, especially when compared to activities like transportation or heating. |
