## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Agents Are Not Enough.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2412.16241) |This work argues that AI agents, while promising, cannot fully solve the challenges of autonomous task execution. It proposes an ecosystem comprising three components: Agents (focused modules for specific tasks), Sims (digital representations of user preferences and behaviors), and Assistants (coordinators between users, Sims, and Agents). |
|[2 OLMo 2 Furious.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656) |This work introduces an improved architecture, advanced training methods, and a specialized data mixture called Dolmino Mix 1124. Released in 7B and 13B parameter scales with fully transparent training data and code, the model matches or exceeds the performance of open-weight models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while requiring fewer computational resources. Its instruction-tuned version, OLMo 2-Instruct, remains competitive with comparable models. |
|[Do NOT Think That Much for 2+3=? On the Overthinking of o1-Like LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21187) | This work proposes a self-training strategy to address overthinking in o1-like LLMs, reducing token output by 48.6% while maintaining accuracy on the MATH500 test set, as demonstrated with QwQ-32B-Preview.|
|[MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in Clinical Notes.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19260) | MEDEC is a publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, focusing on five error types: Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism. It includes 3,848 clinical texts, with 488 clinical notes from three U.S. hospital systems. Experiments show that Claude 3.5 Sonnet excels in error detection, while o1-preview outperforms in error correction.|
|[Aviary: training language agents on challenging scientific tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21154) |An extensible open-source gymnasium designed to develop language agents that outperform zero-shot frontier LLMs and even humans on various challenging scientific tasks. |
|[Memory Layers at Scale.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764) |This work demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of memory layers, showing that models equipped with these layers outperform traditional dense models using half the computation, especially on factual tasks. It includes a parallelizable memory layer implementation that scales to 128B memory parameters and 1 trillion training tokens, validated against base models up to 8B parameters. |
|[HuatuoGPT-o1, Towards Medical Complex Reasoning with LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18925) |This work introduces a novel approach to enhance medical reasoning in language models through a medical verifier that validates outputs and guides the development of complex reasoning skills. The system combines fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifier-based rewards in a two-stage process, achieving superior performance over existing models using just 40,000 verifiable medical problems. |
