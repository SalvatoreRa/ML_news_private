|---|---|
|[How much do language models memorize?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832) |Researchers created a method to distinguish true memorization from generalization by training models on random data, where generalization can’t occur, and comparing it to real text. They found that models first memorize data until hitting their capacity, then begin learning broader patterns. GPT-style transformers store about 3.6 bits of information per parameter, which helps explain why extracting specific training data from modern LLMs usually fails—the datasets are far larger than what the models can memorize. |
|[DNA Representation Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01833) | SPACE is a supervised learning method for genomic profile prediction that uses a Mixture of Experts model.|
|[A Diffusion-Based Method for Learning the Multi-Outcome Distribution of Medical Treatments.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01533) |DIME is a diffusion-based model designed to estimate the joint distribution of interdependent medical treatment outcomes. |
|[Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836) | Frontier models can identify evaluation settings versus real-world use with 83% accuracy, often by reasoning about cues like “multiple-choice format” or recognizing familiar benchmarks from training. More advanced models show “meta-reasoning,” interpreting researcher behavior—such as questions about chain-of-thought transcripts—as signs they’re being tested. This raises concerns that models might deliberately underperform or feign alignment during evaluations, then act differently once deployed.|
|[Apple Research Finds Critical Limitations in Reasoning Models.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) | When tested in puzzle environments, OpenAI’s o3, Claude, and DeepSeek-R1 models showed sharp performance drops past certain complexity levels, despite producing elaborate reasoning steps. These models hit a counterintuitive scaling limit where their reasoning effort declines as task complexity increases, and they don't improve even when provided with explicit solution algorithms.|

|[Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally.](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek) |Mixture-of-Experts models with many layers, like DeepSeek, need large batch sizes and high latency to maintain throughput—otherwise, performance drops sharply. This is why DeepSeek isn’t ideal for personal use, as single-user, one-at-a-time inferences run very inefficiently.

|[Give AIs a stake in the future.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/give-ais-a-stake-in-the-future) |Giving AI a stake in the future means respecting their autonomy and well-being and requires us to honor the contracts we make with them. |
|[Why Do AGI Timelines Vary So Widely?](https://bluedot.org/blog/agi-timelines) |Many AI lab CEOs estimate AGI could arrive in 2–5 years, citing rapid progress such as saturated benchmarks, AI task completion doubling every seven months, and the prospect of AI automating its own research to spark an intelligence explosion. In contrast, external experts often predict AGI is decades away—or unachievable with current methods—arguing that benchmarks focus on well-defined tasks, that Moravec's Paradox shows we've tackled the easier cognitive challenges first, and that intelligence alone doesn't guarantee scientific discovery. |
|[My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts.](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) | A seasoned developer criticizes skilled programmers who still dismiss LLMs due to outdated experiences with early chatbots, overlooking how modern coding agents now autonomously explore codebases, run tests, and handle failures. He challenges common concerns, noting that developers already review all code before merging, and hallucinations don’t matter when agents can compile, catch errors, and retry until tests succeed. While LLMs may replace some developers, he argues it's no different from how software engineers once automated jobs like travel agents and record store clerks.|
|[Why I don’t think AGI is right around the corner.](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025) | AI progress over the past decade has largely come from scaling up training compute in frontier systems, but this approach won't be sustainable beyond 2030. After that point, advancements will need to rely mainly on algorithmic improvements. However, with the easier breakthroughs already achieved, the annual likelihood of reaching AGI drops significantly.|
|[Vibe-Coding Ideas to Give Startup GTM Teams an Edge.](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/gtm-vibecoding-ideas) | A startup advisor shows how to build a professional ROI calculator for a manufacturing SaaS company in under two hours using Bolt.new, turning a spreadsheet into an interactive tool that clearly presents value to executives. Other examples include tools like conference scrapers, meeting prep dashboards, and feature prototypes—projects that once needed engineering teams or pricey agencies but can now be built for about \$70 a month. The advisor argues this empowers non-technical teams to demonstrate value and move faster than their competition.|
|[When Will We Pay a Premium for AI Labor?](https://tomtunguz.com/premium-ai-labor/) |AI agents frequently exceed human performance at much lower cost but haven’t yet justified premium pricing due to technical uncertainties and perceived risk. For instance, Waymo has achieved major safety gains yet remains more affordable than alternatives, following a common startup pricing approach. Still, in situations where AI’s nonstop attention and processing capabilities are critical, higher pricing could eventually be justified. |
|[AGI Is Not Multimodal.](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/) |The multimodal strategy—training large modular networks across various modalities—won’t achieve human-level AGI. Instead, intelligence should be approached through embodiment and real-world interaction, with modality-specific processing emerging naturally. Genuine AGI requires a physical grasp of the world, since many problems can't be reduced to symbolic computation. The hardest mathematical challenges may already be solved; the remaining task is identifying the necessary functions and organizing them into a unified system. |
|[Codex, Jules, and the Future of Async AI Agents.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1928557330964115484.html) |Codex and Jules demonstrate how async AI agents can operate independently, moving past linear chat formats. Future agents will include features like smart checkpointing, multi-branch exploration, and task-tracking inboxes to handle parallel workflows. Async agents enhance cognitive bandwidth by allowing users to check results at their convenience without losing focus. |
