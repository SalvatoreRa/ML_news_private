|[Transformer2 : Self-adaptive LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252) |Transformer² is a self-adaptation framework designed to adapt LLMs to unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting specific components of their weight matrices. It operates through two main phases: 1) A dispatch system analyzes and identifies properties of the incoming task. 2) Task-specific behaviors are generated by combining "expert" vectors trained through reinforcement learning. The framework claims to be more efficient than LoRA, requiring fewer parameters, and is compatible with various LLM architectures. |
|[MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08313) |This series introduces new models incorporating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), featuring a model with 32 experts and 456 billion parameters, with 45.9 billion activated per token. The models claim to match the performance of state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4o and |
