|[The Levers of Political Persuasion with Conversational AI.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13919) | Researchers evaluated 19 language models on over 76,000 participants and discovered that specialized post-training methods increased persuasiveness by up to 51%, significantly more than gains from larger models alone. The top-performing approach involved prompting models to include dense factual content, but this led to a concerning downside: the most persuasive responses were also the most inaccurate.|
|[Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17702?utm_source=tldrai) | Efficiency Leverage (EL) measures the computational benefits of Mixture-of-Experts models. Drawing on results from more than 300 models, the authors introduce scaling laws that estimate EL from MoE setup parameters.|

|[Six Principles for Production AI Agents.](https://www.app.build/blog/six-principles-production-ai-agents?utm_source=tldrai) |Building effective AI agents requires solid system design and sound software engineering. Developers should prioritize clear instructions, efficient context handling, strong tool integration, and automated validation over relying on perfect prompts or sophisticated frameworks. Thorough error analysis is crucial—models should aid in identifying failure points so those issues can be methodically resolved. The aim is to develop agents that are dependable, resilient to failure, and capable of ongoing improvement. |
|[AI is eating the Internet.](https://fika.bar/paoramen/ai-is-eating-the-internet-01K10JG1SHGZQHN61HPGWPXN60?utm_source=tldrai) |Advertising helped create an Internet that was largely free and accessible. AI has brought a new challenge for content creators: bots scraping websites for training data without offering anything in exchange. In response, creators are implementing paywalls or blocking bots. As AI-generated content spreads, people are gravitating toward more genuine spaces, forming a cozy web of smaller, niche communities. |
