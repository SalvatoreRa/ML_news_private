|[Enhancing Robustness in Large Language Models: Prompting for Mitigating the Impact of Irrelevant Information.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10615) |  proposes a two-stage prompting technique to remove irrelevant information from context; it serves as a self-mitigation process that first identifies the irrelevant information and then filters it out; this leads to enhancement in robustness of the model and overall better performance on reasoning tasks.|
|[MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11049) |demonstrates how speculative decoding can improve throughput, lower latency, and preserve accuracy in long context generation scenarios; it discovers that bottlenecks change from compute-bound to memory-bound as sequence length and batch size increase; with these realizations, they demonstrate that speculative decoding can be used more successfully for longer sequences, even when using large batch sizes.  |
|[PEDAL: Enhancing Greedy Decoding with Large Language Models using Diverse Exemplars.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08869) | employs a hybrid self-ensembling approach (based on diverse exemplars) to enhance LLM performance overall. Specifically, it generates multiple candidate responses using diverse exemplars and aggregates them using an LLM to produce a final response; this approach achieves lower cost compared to self-consistency approaches and better accuracy compared to greedy decoding.|
|[Autonomous Driving with Spiking Neural Networks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19687v1) |The first unified Spiking Neural Network (SNN) designed to tackle the energy issues associated with autonomous driving is called Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD). |
|[Pre-training Small Base LMs with Fewer Tokens.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08634v1) |By inheriting a few transformer blocks and training on a very small percentage (0.1%) of the initial data, Inheritune is a simplified technique for creating smaller base language models from larger ones. With just one A6000 GPU and this method, a 1.5B parameter model could be created in less than 30 minutes, with performance comparable to larger models trained on much greater amounts of data. |
|[Teaching chat models to solve chess puzzles.](https://raw.sh/posts/chess_puzzles) |At 1800 elo on average, traditional base language models are rather competent chess players. Nevertheless, chat models frequently see a sharp decline in performance. This article explains how to use prompting and fine-tuning to teach conversation models, such as GPT-4o, to play chess. |

The model makes use of a diffusion transformer (DiT) for enhanced temporal consistency and generalization and a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE) for video data compression, which lowers processing requirements.|
|[Memory-Efficient LLM Training with Online Subspace Descent.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12857v1) |Online Subspace Descent is a novel optimizer that increases memory efficiency to improve LLM training.|
|[Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15240) |Typically, reward models are taught to be discriminative classifiers. The reward signal in this DeepMind experiment is the yes/no logits of a language model. It was discovered that enabling a model to incorporate ensembling and CoT increased performance by sixteen percent. |
|[Multilingual Arbitrage: Optimizing Data Pools to Accelerate Multilingual Progress.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14960) |By using the discrepancy between routing synthetic data creation and oracle model performance, Cohere's Aya model was able to significantly increase its win rate in comparison to baseline models. |
