|[Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19594) | Using this LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge approach enhances the LLM's ability to judge and follow instructions; simply self-improvement to produce better responses (act) saturates quickly; this work enhances the LLM's ability to judge itself (judge) to avoid issues like reward hacking; in addition to the act and judge roles, a third role called meta-judge is used to evaluate the model's own judgments. This approach, known as meta- rewarding LLMs, proposes a self-improving alignment technique (no human supervision) where the LLM judges its own judgments and uses the feedback to improve its judgment skills.|
|[MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20183) | In MindSearch, a multi-agent framework based on LLM is presented for complex web-information seeking and integration tasks. A web planner is utilized to efficiently break down complex queries, while a web searcher performs hierarchical information retrieval on the Internet to enhance the relevance of the retrieved information. An iterative graph construction is employed in the planning component to better model complex problem-solving processes. The multi-agent framework is better suited for handling long context problems by assigning retrieval and reasoning tasks to specialized agents.|
|[Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19813) |Enhanced RAG through Self-Reasoning - utilizes the reasoning trajectories produced by the LLM itself to offer an end-to-end self-reasoning framework that enhances the dependability and traceability of RAG systems. The LLM is utilized to do the following three procedures: This method helps the model be more selective, reason and distinguish relevant and irrelevant documents, thus improving the accuracy of the RAG system as a whole. 1) Relevance-aware: evaluates the relevance between the retrieved documents and the question; 2) Evidence-aware selective: selects and cites relevant documents, and then automatically selects key sentence snippets as evidence from the cited documents; and 3) Trajectory analysis: generates a concise analysis based on all gathered self-reasoning trajectories generated by the preceding 2 processes, and then provides the final inferred answer. Using only 2,000 training examples, the framework outperforms GPT-4. (produced by GPT-4) |
|[Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19825) |Constrained-CoT, a model that restricts the reasoning output length without compromising performance, demonstrates that increasing the LLaMA2-70b's reasoning limit to 100 words increases accuracy on GSM8K from 36.01% (CoT) to 41.07% (CCoT) while lowering the average output length by 28 words. |
