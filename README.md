|[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034) |Harvard and Western University researchers propose a wave-based recurrent neural network that uses traveling neural waves for global spatial integration in visual tasks. Inspired by the "Hearing the Shape of a Drum" analogy, they model neural activity as locally coupled oscillators, discretizing the 2D wave equation into a convolutional recurrent network. Unlike standard RNNs, their model aggregates information across entire wave evolution, enhancing segmentation tasks requiring large receptive fields. It rivals deeper CNNs and U-Nets with fewer parameters on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The approach may also align with neuroscience, reflecting observed traveling wave dynamics in the brain. |

|[Gemma 3 Technical Report.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/Gemma3Report.pdf) | Gemma 3 is a lightweight open model family (1Bâ€“27B parameters) with multimodal capabilities, extended context length (up to 128K tokens), and multilingual support. It integrates a frozen SigLIP vision encoder, using a Pan & Scan method for better image processing and handling diverse aspect ratios. Its hybrid attention system reduces memory usage for long-context tasks. Advanced knowledge distillation and quantization (int4, switched-fp8) allow for efficient deployment on consumer GPUs and edge devices. Instruction tuning enhances performance in benchmarks like MMLU, coding, and chat, placing it among the top models. Supporting over 140 languages, it enables structured outputs and function calling for agentic workflows while ensuring safety and privacy through data filtering and reduced memorization.|
