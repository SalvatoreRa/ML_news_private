|[Rope to Nope and Back Again: A New Hybrid Attention Strategy.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18795) |Llama 4's breakthrough in handling over 10 million tokens in context comes from alternating between no positional embeddings and rotational positional embeddings. Although current benchmarks are limited to Needle in the Haystack, they strongly suggest the effectiveness of this alternating layer approach. |
|[Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495) |This DeepSeek paper explores using inference-time scaling to improve reward modeling as a way to develop stronger reasoners. It suggests a larger plan by the Chinese start-up to leverage its current reasoning models as a foundation for building the next wave of reward models to train future reasoners. |

|[Llama 4.](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) | Meta has introduced Llama 4 Scout and Maverick, two 17B-parameter multimodal models delivering top-tier results on key benchmarks, as well as Llama 4 Behemoth, a 288B model still in training that outperforms GPT-4.5 in STEM-related tasks.|
|[Midjourney V7.](https://www.midjourney.com/updates/v7-alpha) | Midjourney has launched its V7 alpha image generation model, featuring improved text understanding, enhanced image consistency, and a new Draft Mode for quick, budget-friendly iterations, along with support for voice commands and personalization.| 
|[AI masters Minecraft: DeepMind program finds diamonds without being taught.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w) |DeepMind's AI system, Dreamer, managed to learn how to collect diamonds in Minecraft without any human instruction, marking progress toward more general AI. Through reinforcement learning, Dreamer explores and models the game world on its own to forecast actions and results. This development points to possible real-world uses where trial-and-error learning would be expensive. |
|[OpenAI’s models ‘memorized’ copyrighted content, new study suggests.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/openais-models-memorized-copyrighted-content-new-study-suggests/) | A new study appears to lend credence to allegations that OpenAI trained at least some of its AI models on copyrighted content.|
|[UK Home Office loses attempt to keep legal battle with Apple secret.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/07/uk-home-office-loses-attempt-to-keep-legal-battle-with-apple-secret) |Judges reject Home Office’s attempt to withhold from public details of case concerning access of Apple users’ data |

|[Unsupervised Panoptic Segmentation.](https://visinf.github.io/cups/) | CUPS is a novel approach to panoptic segmentation that requires no labeled data, using depth and motion cues to learn directly from scene-centric images.|
|[Generative Modeling for Crystals.](https://github.com/deepmodeling/crystalformer) | CrystalFormer is a transformer-based model that creates crystal structures by leveraging space group symmetry, enhancing efficiency and reducing data requirements in crystal generation.|
|[Nano Aha Moment.](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/nano-aha-moment) | A single file, single GPU, from scratch full parameter tuning library that replicates DeepSeek R1-Zero style training.|
|[Object Counting.](https://github.com/AhmedZgaren/Save) | A fully automated zero-shot object counting approach that uses feature maps and self-attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results on the FSC147 dataset.|
|[DeepSeek 1.58bit GGUF.](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S) |The Unsloth team identified which parts of the new R1 model can be effectively quantized, noting some tokenizer quirks that complicate the process. In short, only the MoE layers are quantized to 1.58 bits, while the rest stay at 4 or 6 bits using their dynamic quantization approach. |
|[Granite Speech 8B.](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-speech-3.2-8b) |IBM silently launched a state-of-the-art speech recognition and understanding model based on its Granite series. |
|[Start building with Gemini 2.5 Pro.](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-preview-model-billing-update/) | Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is now in public preview via the Gemini API on Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI availability coming soon.|

|[Cyberattacks by AI agents are coming.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/04/1114228/cyberattacks-by-ai-agents-are-coming) | AI agents are becoming powerful assets in cybersecurity, capable of carrying out sophisticated attacks and scaling operations such as ransomware. The LLM Agent Honeypot project seeks to identify these agents by mimicking vulnerable servers, showing that agents are more adaptable and evasive than typical bots. Experts expect a rise in agent-led cyberattacks and emphasize the need to proactively build defenses as the technology advances.|
|[The artifact isn’t the art: Rethinking creativity in the age of AI.](https://www.freethink.com/opinion/studio-ghibli-chatgpt-creativity) | 
AI-generated Ghibli-style visuals have surged in popularity, straining OpenAI's servers and sparking debates about creativity in the AI age. While AI can rapidly produce artistic images, it lacks the human ability to experience and synthesize complex ideas and emotions. The future of creativity will focus on meaningful outputs shaped by human insight and purpose, with AI as a tool rather than a creator.|
|[How does the brain control consciousness? This deep-brain structure.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01021-2) | In a world of constant stimulation, the thalamus filters which thoughts we become aware of and which we don’t.|
