|---|---|
|[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v1) |This approach utilizes long-context LLMs by preloading all relevant documents and precomputing the key-value (KV) cache in advance. The preloaded context enables the model to deliver contextually accurate answers without requiring real-time retrieval. The authors propose that CAG serves as an effective alternative to RAG for scenarios where the retrievable documents or knowledge are limited and manageable in size. |
|[Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04227) |This approach employs LLM agents to perform the entire research process. Key findings include: 1) agents powered by o1-preview deliver the best research outcomes, 2) generated machine learning code achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, 3) human feedback enhances research quality, and 4) Agent Laboratory drastically reduces research costs. |
|[Long Context vs. RAG for LLMs: An Evaluation and Revisits.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01880) |This study evaluates long-context (LC) LLMs against RAG systems, with three key findings: 1) LC generally outperforms RAG on question-answering benchmarks, 2) summarization-based retrieval performs on par with LC, while chunk-based retrieval falls behind, and 3) RAG excels in dialogue-based and general question queries. |
|[Search-o1: Agentic Search-Enhanced Large Reasoning Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05366) | This framework integrates large reasoning models (LRMs) with agentic search and document refinement capabilities to address knowledge insufficiency. It facilitates autonomous knowledge retrieval during reasoning and achieves superior performance on complex tasks, surpassing both baseline models and human experts.|
|[Towards System 2 Reasoning in LLMs: Learning How to Think With Meta Chain-of-Thought.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04682) |Meta Chain-of-Thought (Meta-CoT) extends traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by modeling the underlying reasoning needed to arrive at a specific CoT. The approach argues that CoT is simplistic, while Meta-CoT better aligns with the cognitive processes required for advanced problem-solving. |
|[rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04519) | A new approach introduces three key components to improve mathematical reasoning: 1) A code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data synthesis method using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate verified step-by-step reasoning trajectories for training the policy SLM. 2) An SLM-based process reward model (PRM) that accurately assigns reward labels to each math reasoning step. 3) A self-evolution strategy where the policy SLM and PRM iteratively evolve to enhance math reasoning. On the MATH benchmark, rStar-Math boosts Qwen2.5-Math-7B from 58.8% to 90.0% and Phi3-mini-3.8B from 41.4% to 86.4%, outperforming o1-preview by +4.5% and +0.9%, respectively.|
|[Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI.](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2025-01_cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-physical-ai) | This framework trains Physical AI systems in digital environments prior to real-world deployment. It features pre-trained world foundation models that serve as digital twins of the physical world, enabling AI systems to learn and interact safely without risking damage to hardware. These models can be fine-tuned for applications such as camera control, robotic manipulation, and autonomous driving.|
|[Process Reinforcement through Implicit Rewards.](https://curvy-check-498.notion.site/Process-Reinforcement-through-Implicit-Rewards-15f4fcb9c42180f1b498cc9b2eaf896f) | This framework introduces online reinforcement learning with process rewards to enhance language model reasoning. The algorithm integrates online prompt filtering, RLOO return/advantage estimation, PPO loss, and implicit process reward modeling for continuous updates. On the AIME 2024 benchmark, their model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, achieves a 26.7% pass@1, outperforming GPT-4 and other models while using only one-tenth of the training data compared to similar systems.|
|[Can LLMs Design Good Questions Based on Context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03491) | This framework applies online reinforcement learning with process rewards to improve language model reasoning, combining online prompt filtering, RLOO return/advantage estimation, PPO loss, and implicit process reward modeling for continuous updates. On the AIME 2024 benchmark, the Eurus-2-7B-PRIME model achieves a 26.7% pass@1, surpassing GPT-4 and other models while utilizing just one-tenth of the training data used by comparable systems.|
|[KaLM-Embedding: Superior Training Data Brings A Stronger Embedding Model.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01028) |This approach presents a high-performing, decoder-only embeddings model built on Qwen2-0.5B. By applying advanced data filtering methods, it achieves a remarkably powerful and open embedding model suited for retrieval tasks. |
|[LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06186v1) |LlamaV-o1 is a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models. |
|[The Lessons of Developing Process Reward Models in Mathematical Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07301) | This marks a significant step toward open replication of reasoning models. The Qwen team has released their trained reward model, which supervises the generation process for reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning. Alongside the paper, they have also shared the weights for this Process Reward Model on Hugging Face.|
|[How GPT learns layer by layer.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07108v1) |This paper examines how LLMs construct internal world models, highlighting their significance in creating agents that exhibit consistent and adaptive behavior across various tasks. |
|[Joint speech and text machine translation for up to 100 languages.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08359-z) |SEAMLESSM4T is a single machine translation tool that supports speech-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation and automatic speech recognition between up to 100 languages. |
|[Metadata Conditioning Accelerates Language Model Pre-training.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01956) |Recent research on generic pretraining has been limited, but this study demonstrates that incorporating metadata early in training and gradually reducing its influence towards the end enhances overall model performance. |
