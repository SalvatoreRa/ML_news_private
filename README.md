|[Spelltest: AI-to-AI Testing for LLM Based Applications](https://github.com/artas728/spelltest) | Today's AI-driven applications largely depend on Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to deliver innovative solutions. However, ensuring that they provide relevant and accurate responses in every situation is a challenge. Spelltest addresses this by simulating LLM responses using synthetic user personas and an evaluation technique to evaluate these responses automatically(but still requires human supervision).|
