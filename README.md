|[The First Few Tokens Are All You Need.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02875) |Researchers from Tencent AI Lab and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen propose a method to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only the first few tokens of generated solutions. This approach focuses on Prefix Self-Consistency, where the initial tokens often share core reasoning steps, making fine-tuning on these prefixes effective. It uses Minimal Token Training, which reduces computational cost by up to 16 times compared to full-chain fine-tuning while maintaining reasoning structure. Despite being unsupervised, this method performs as well as or better than more computationally intensive methods. It works across various LLM architectures and can scale from small to large datasets, with the option to incorporate ground-truth checks to improve accuracy. |
