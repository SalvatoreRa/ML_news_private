|[Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19594) | Using this LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge approach enhances the LLM's ability to judge and follow instructions; simply self-improvement to produce better responses (act) saturates quickly; this work enhances the LLM's ability to judge itself (judge) to avoid issues like reward hacking; in addition to the act and judge roles, a third role called meta-judge is used to evaluate the model's own judgments. This approach, known as meta- rewarding LLMs, proposes a self-improving alignment technique (no human supervision) where the LLM judges its own judgments and uses the feedback to improve its judgment skills.|
|[MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20183) | In MindSearch, a multi-agent framework based on LLM is presented for complex web-information seeking and integration tasks. A web planner is utilized to efficiently break down complex queries, while a web searcher performs hierarchical information retrieval on the Internet to enhance the relevance of the retrieved information. An iterative graph construction is employed in the planning component to better model complex problem-solving processes. The multi-agent framework is better suited for handling long context problems by assigning retrieval and reasoning tasks to specialized agents.|
|[Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19813) |Enhanced RAG through Self-Reasoning - utilizes the reasoning trajectories produced by the LLM itself to offer an end-to-end self-reasoning framework that enhances the dependability and traceability of RAG systems. The LLM is utilized to do the following three procedures: This method helps the model be more selective, reason and distinguish relevant and irrelevant documents, thus improving the accuracy of the RAG system as a whole. 1) Relevance-aware: evaluates the relevance between the retrieved documents and the question; 2) Evidence-aware selective: selects and cites relevant documents, and then automatically selects key sentence snippets as evidence from the cited documents; and 3) Trajectory analysis: generates a concise analysis based on all gathered self-reasoning trajectories generated by the preceding 2 processes, and then provides the final inferred answer. Using only 2,000 training examples, the framework outperforms GPT-4. (produced by GPT-4) |
|[Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19825) |Constrained-CoT, a model that restricts the reasoning output length without compromising performance, demonstrates that increasing the LLaMA2-70b's reasoning limit to 100 words increases accuracy on GSM8K from 36.01% (CoT) to 41.07% (CCoT) while lowering the average output length by 28 words. |
|[ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018) | ThinK  focuses on long-context scenarios and inference; it offers a query-dependent KV cache pruning method to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least important channels. HinK - aims to address inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption.|
|[Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787) | A group of scientists discovered that benchmark performance can be significantly improved at a 3x lower cost than with a larger model if you sample from tiny models on a regular basis, provided that you have adequate coverage and a verification tool.|
|[Boosting Audio Visual Question Answering via Key Semantic-Aware Cues.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20693v1) | A Temporal-Spatial Perception Model (TSPM) has been established by researchers to enhance the capacity to respond to inquiries concerning auditory and visual signals in videos.|
|[No learning rates needed: Introducing SALSA -- Stable Armijo Line Search Adaptation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20650v1) |This work presents enhancements to line search strategies that improve the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent systems. |
|[Automated Review Generation Method Based on Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20906v1) |Utilizing LLMs, researchers have created an automated approach for generating reviews in order to assist in managing the massive amount of scientific material. |
|[CLEFT: Language-Image Contrastive Learning with Efficient Large Language Model and Prompt Fine-Tuning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21011v1) | CLEFT is a Contrastive Learning technique meant for medical imaging that aims to overcome the drawbacks of current, resource-intensive CLIP-like methods.|
|[Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314) |To boost model performance, there is a lot of demand to leverage computation at inference time. This essay explores the trade-offs made between various approaches and presents a number of useful ones. This often suggests a larger trend of getting more performance out of smaller machines. |
|[An Object is Worth 64x64 Pixels: Generating 3D Object via Image Diffusion.](https://omages.github.io/) |It is easy to utilize a DiT model to generate unique things based on textual inputs by treating 3D objects as UV wrapped images. |

|[AI existential risk probabilities are too unreliable to inform policy.](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-existential-risk-probabilities) |The use of AI existential risk probability estimates for policymaking is criticized in this essay, which contends that these estimates are excessively erratic and lack a strong inductive or deductive foundation, frequently approximating educated guesses rather than fact-based projections. The authors argue against the validity of using these projections to inform public policy, particularly when they are connected to expensive or restricting measures, and they support an evidence-based strategy that takes AI development uncertainty into account.

|[Lookback Lens: Detecting and Mitigating Contextual Hallucinations in Large Language Models Using Only Attention Maps.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07071) |Contextual Hallucinations Mitigation in LLMs: This paper presents a novel approach that both detects and reduces contextual hallucinations in LLMs (e.g., reduces by 10% in the XSum summarization task). It does this by building a hallucination detection model based on input features provided by the ratio of attention weights on the context vs. newly generated tokens (for each attention head). The theory behind this approach is that contextual hallucinations are related to the degree to which an LLM attends to the contextual information provided.
