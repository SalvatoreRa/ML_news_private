|[Runway Aleph Video Model.](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-aleph) | Runway's Aleph is a new in-context video model that can edit, transform, and generate videos with high accuracy, handling tasks such as object manipulation, changing camera angles, and adjusting style or lighting.|
|[Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507) | Alibaba's new open-source thinking model scores 92.3% on the AIME25 math benchmark, equaling OpenAI's O4-mini and outperforming it on coding tasks with 74.1% on LiveCodeBench. The 235B-parameter mixture-of-experts model only activates 22B parameters at a time, offering greater efficiency than standard dense models|
|[CollabLLM.](https://github.com/Wuyxin/collabllm) |CollabLLM is an open-source framework that teaches language models to ask strategic questions and steer conversations by using a "Multiturn-aware Reward" system, which judges responses based on their long-term effect on the dialogue rather than short-term helpfulness. |
|[AgenticSeek.](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek) | A fully local, voice-enabled AI assistant that autonomously browses the web, writes code, and plans tasks. It was designed to be a private open-source alternative to Manus AI with no cloud dependencies.|
|[Using GitHub Spark to reverse engineer GitHub Spark .](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/24/github-spark/) | GitHub Spark is GitHub's implementation of the prompt-to-app pattern - this post explores its system prompt in detail.|
|[Faster Hugging Face CLI.](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-cli) |Hugging Face has renamed its CLI from huggingface-cli to hf, reorganizing the command structure into a more intuitive format. |

|[Why China isn't about to leap ahead of the West on compute.](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/why-china-isnt-about-to-leap-ahead-of-the-west-on-compute) |Chinese hardware has narrowed the performance gap with NVIDIA's newest chips from 10x to about 3x, but over 90% of major Chinese language models since 2017 have still been trained using Western hardware. Low chip manufacturing yields—SMIC operates below 50% compared to TSMC’s 90%—and underdeveloped software ecosystems continue to push Chinese developers toward NVIDIA when they have access. |
|[Claude Code in Practice: Anthropic Case Study.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-anthropic-teams-use-claude-code) |This case study explores how Anthropic's internal teams, from legal to engineering, are using Claude Code to automate tasks, bridge skill gaps, and accelerate complex projects. |
|[The Story of the World's First AI-Organized Event.](http://lesswrong.com/posts/b3M8qKPDv756gmQph/the-story-of-the-world-s-first-ai-organized-event) |An AI orchestrated a successful event, handling tasks such as scheduling, marketing, and logistics. The event highlighted AI's potential to automate complex organizational tasks. This advancement could streamline event management and reduce human workload. |
|[Everything I've Learned so far About OpenAI's Agents.](https://leonfurze.com/2025/07/21/everything-ive-learned-so-far-about-openais-agents/) |This article explores the capabilities and limitations of OpenAI's new Agents, detailing their current applications and tools. It includes examples of tasks completed by the agents but also highlights numerous things they still can't do, along with various performance and output problems that make the product feel incomplete. |
|[The Cloud Cost Conundrum: Rising Expenses Hinder AI Innovation in Europe.](https://www.akamai.com/blog/cloud/2025/jul/cloud-cost-conundrum-rising-expenses-hinder-ai-innovation-europe) |Rising cloud infrastructure costs are hindering AI progress in Europe, with compute-heavy tasks like model training facing tight budget limits. Startups say they're being forced to cut back on experiments or postpone launches due to growing expenses. To stay globally competitive, innovators in the region are pushing for more efficient system designs and better pricing structures. |
|[AI models are neglecting African languages — scientists want to change that.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02292-5) | Scientists record 9,000 hours of languages spoken in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa as free-access training data for AI models.|
