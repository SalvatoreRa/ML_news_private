|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Large Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662) |Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed human persuaders in a controlled study, achieving a 7.6% higher success rate in influencing participants' quiz responses. It was more effective at steering users toward both correct answers (+12.2%) and incorrect ones (-15.1%). |
|[Robustness of LLM-based Safety Judges.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04474) | The study reveals weaknesses in LLM-based safety judges, demonstrating that their assessments can be heavily influenced by prompt variations and adversarial attacks.|
|[Introducing the AI Gateway.](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-gateway) |Vercel has launched an AI Gateway for alpha testing, enabling easy switching between ~100 AI models without managing API keys or accounts. |
|[Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400) | [FutureHouse](https://www.futurehouse.org/research-announcements/demonstrating-end-to-end-scientific-discovery-with-robin-a-multi-agent-system) used a continuous experimental loop combining literature search agents and a data analysis agent to speed up medical discovery. The system autonomously forms hypotheses from literature, suggests experiments for humans to carry out, and then analyzes the results to guide further research. This approach led to the identification of ripasudil, an eye drop that reduces cellular tension, as a potential treatment for age-related vision loss caused by the gradual decline of retinal light-sensitive cells. All code, data, and agent interaction logs will be publicly released on May 27.|
|[Slow Thinking Improves Confidence in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14489v1) | Extended chain-of-thought reasoning helps large language models better calibrate their confidence.|
|[AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery.](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf) |AlphaEvolve, developed by Google DeepMind, is a coding agent that uses LLM-guided evolution to optimize algorithms and computational systems. It combines code generation, evaluation, and iterative refinement to drive discovery, exemplified by its development of a new 4×4 complex matrix multiplication algorithm using 48 multiplications, surpassing Strassen’s 1969 result. AlphaEvolve has improved mathematical bounds in problems like Erdős’s minimum overlap and the kissing number in 11 dimensions, while also optimizing Google’s compute infrastructure, from data center scheduling and matrix kernels to TPU circuits and compiler code. The system employs ensembles of Gemini models, advanced prompts, full-file evolution, and multi-objective filtering, with each element essential to its success, as shown by ablation studies. |
|[LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120) | LLMs degrade heavily in performance during multi-turn interactions with underspecified prompts, dropping 39% on average. Issues include premature answers, reliance on prior mistakes, and loss of middle-turn info. Sharded simulations reveal the problem across tasks, with interventions like recapping only partially effective. The paper concludes that the problem lies in model internals, not prompting.|
|[Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One Training Example.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571) | RLVR dramatically boosts LLM math reasoning: just one example can match the performance of models trained on thousands. On Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, 1-shot RLVR raises MATH500 accuracy from 36.0% to 73.6%, while 2-shot slightly surpasses that. This data efficiency generalizes across models and tasks, with post-saturation gains, domain transfer, and improved self-reflection. Policy gradient loss drives the gains, not weight decay.|
|[SEM: Reinforcement Learning for Search-Efficient Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07903) |SEM is an RL-based framework that teaches LLMs when to use external search and when to rely on internal knowledge, improving accuracy while reducing unnecessary search. Trained on balanced datasets (Musique for unknowns, MMLU for knowns) with structured prompts, SEM uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for targeted reward shaping. It outperforms Naive RAG and ReSearch on HotpotQA and MuSiQue while cutting search rates on MMLU and GSM8K by over 40x. |
|[Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think.](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/71876fabef0f0ed4/original/reasoning_models_paper.pdf) |Anthropic’s research shows that chain-of-thought (CoT) rarely reflects what AI models actually use to reason, with models revealing their reasoning hints under 20% of the time. Even outcome-based RL only slightly improves faithfulness, and reward hacks often go unspoken. This challenges the trustworthiness of CoT as a transparency tool, highlighting risks for safety in high-stakes AI applications. |
