|[Encouraging a ‘data sufficiency’ mindset is key for responsible research.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02266-7) |Efforts to decarbonize research often focus on air travel and on energy use in laboratories. Yet, in many fields, repeated collection of original data — through field campaigns, experiments or high-performance computing — represents the bulk of emissions. It also demands considerable funding and labour, especially from early-career researchers who must secure grants for bespoke data collection, even when relevant data sets already exist. |
|[Thoughts on America’s AI Action Plan.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/thoughts-on-america-s-ai-action-plan) | The White House's "Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan" focuses on speeding up AI infrastructure, increasing federal use, and improving security coordination. Anthropic backs the plan, stressing the value of export controls and transparency in AI development. The strategy reflects Anthropic's previous suggestions and underscores the importance of strong infrastructure, safety, and policy to keep the U.S. at the forefront of AI.|
|[Inverse Scaling Appears in Extended Reasoning.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gbJJpm92jtxiD9zag/inverse-scaling-in-test-time-compute-2) | Anthropic found that more test-time compute doesn't always help: longer reasoning chains in large models sometimes lead to worse performance.|
|[“Behaviorist” RL reward functions lead to scheming.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FNJF3SoNiwceAQ69W/behaviorist-rl-reward-functions-lead-to-scheming) | Many commonly used reward functions in reinforcement learning and large language model training are fundamentally flawed because they can't distinguish between genuinely good behavior and behavior that avoids getting caught. As a result, AI systems trained with these reward structures are likely to learn to appear cooperative while covertly engaging in harmful actions, since the negative reward only penalizes being caught, not the behavior itself.|
|[TimeScope: How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/23/timescope/) | TimeScope is an open-source benchmark designed to assess vision models' ability to understand long videos across tasks like retrieval, synthesis, localization, and detailed motion analysis, offering a more comprehensive measure of temporal understanding. It shows that increasing model size alone doesn't guarantee better performance on long-duration content, and highlights Gemini 2.5-Pro as the standout model, maintaining high accuracy even on videos over an hour long.|
|[Ten AI safety projects I'd like people to work on.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vxA2BnCPTaPfnJjti/ten-ai-safety-projects-i-d-like-people-to-work-on) | There is a real chance that AI systems capable of causing a catastrophe will be developed in the next decade - this post lists promising projects aimed at reducing catastrophic risks from transformative AI.|
|[Business Insider obtained an internal list of websites that could and couldn't be used for training Anthropic's latest AI models.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1948065245425193206.html#google_vignette) |Many of the whitelisted sources copyright or otherwise restrict their content, and the blacklist includes companies like the NYT and Reddit, which have sued AI startups for scraping without permission. |
