# ML news: Week 21 - 27 October

## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Thinking LLMs: General Instruction Following with Thought Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10630) | The proposed training method aims to enhance LLMs with thinking capabilities for general instruction-following without relying on human-annotated data. It employs an iterative search and optimization process to facilitate thought generation, allowing the model to learn without direct supervision. For each user instruction, potential thoughts are evaluated using a judge model, which scores only the responses to identify the best and worst options. The resulting full outputs are then used as selected and rejected pairs for DPO (termed Thought Preference Optimization in this paper). This approach demonstrates superior performance on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard.|
|[Model Swarms: Collaborative Search to Adapt LLM Experts via Swarm Intelligence.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11163) | A new collaborative search algorithm is proposed to adapt LLMs using swarm intelligence, where a group of LLM experts collaboratively navigates the weight space to optimize a utility function that reflects various adaptation objectives. Experiments show that Model Swarms can effectively adjust LLM experts for a single task, multi-task domains, reward models, and a range of human interests. This approach outperforms 12 model composition baselines by up to 21.0% across different tasks and contexts.|
|[First-Person Fairness in Chatbots.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/first-person-fairness-in-chatbots.pdf) |This study explores first-person fairness, focusing on the fairness of interactions between users and ChatGPT, particularly examining any biases related to users' names. It utilizes a model powered by GPT-4o to analyze patterns and name sensitivity in the chatbot's responses based on different user names. The findings suggest that post-training significantly reduces harmful stereotypes overall. However, in areas such as entertainment and art, especially with open-ended tasks, the study reveals a higher level of bias, indicating a tendency to create narratives featuring protagonists whose gender aligns with the gender inferred from the user's name. |
|[Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787) |The report indicates that LLMs can gain knowledge through introspection that is not directly derivable from their training data. It suggests that these models possess privileged information about themselves, which could contribute to creating more interpretable and controllable systems. However, it also notes that this introspective ability has limitations, as models often struggle to predict their own behavior on tasks that require reasoning over extended outputs. |
|[Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848) |This proposal introduces a unified autoregressive framework for multimodal understanding and generation, which decouples visual encoding into independent pathways. By utilizing a single transformer architecture, it enhances flexibility and performance in both visual understanding and generation tasks. The framework claims to mitigate the trade-offs typically associated with vision tasks found in methods relying on a single visual encoder. As a result, it outperforms previous unified models and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. |
|[Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04343) |This study employs two strategies to explore scaling laws for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): in-context learning (DRAG) and iterative prompting (IterRAG). It discovers that RAG performance steadily enhances with an increase in effective context length when configurations are optimized. Additionally, under optimal conditions, increasing inference computation yields linear improvements in long-context RAG performance. This insight leads to the creation of a computation allocation model designed to offer practical guidance for optimal computation distribution in long-context RAG situations. |
|[Agent S: An Open Agentic Framework that Uses Computers Like a Human.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08164v1) |A novel open agentic framework has been developed to facilitate autonomous interactions with computers via a graphical user interface (GUI). Named Agent S, this framework addresses challenges such as knowledge acquisition, long-horizon planning, and managing dynamic interfaces. It introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning that combines search and retrieval methods. Additionally, it utilizes an agent-computer interface to enable reasoning and control over GUI agents. Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrates that Agent S surpasses the baseline by 9.37% in success rate, representing an 83.6% relative improvement, and sets a new state-of-the-art performance. |
|[Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12613) |The study introduces the concept of model kinship to assess the similarity between LLMs. This measure is utilized to develop a model merging strategy called Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which enhances performance. The authors discover that this new criterion allows for effective and continuous model merging. |
|[On The Planning Abilities of OpenAI's o1 Models: Feasibility, Optimality, and Generalizability.](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.19924) |The report highlights that the o1-preview model excels in self-evaluation and constraint-following. However, it also points out that these o1 models exhibit bottlenecks in decision-making and memory management, particularly in the context of spatial reasoning. Specifically, the models tend to generate redundant actions and face challenges in generalizing across spatially complex tasks. |
|[Sabotage evaluations for frontier models.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/sabotage-evaluations) |Anthropic has conducted several innovative evaluations to identify vulnerabilities and assess misalignment in large, powerful models. |
|[Mini-Omni2: Towards Open-source GPT-4o with Vision, Speech and Duplex Capabilities.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11190) |A powerful open-source initiative aimed at replicating GPT-4's speech capabilities has emerged.

To address this, Eleuther has introduced a set of automatic interpreter features designed to help understand the meaning of elements within their context. |
|[Mitigating Object Hallucination via Concentric Causal Attention.](https://github.com/xing0047/cca-llava) |Object hallucination in vision-language models has been associated with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), which faces challenges in managing long-term dependencies between visual and textual inputs. To overcome this, the authors introduce Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a novel positional alignment method that enhances the interaction between visual elements and instruction tokens. |
|[Simplifying, stabilizing, and scaling continuous-time consistency models.](https://openai.com/index/simplifying-stabilizing-and-scaling-continuous-time-consistency-models/) | OpenAI has published work focusing on enhancing consistency models, which operate in two steps rather than the 1,000 steps typically used in diffusion models. While these models still depend on distillation from an existing diffusion model, the research seeks to improve their performance and stability as they scale.|
|[All you need are 32 tokens to represent video.](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/opensource/xGen-MM-Vid/index.html) |Salesforce's new approach introduces a novel video encoder that significantly reduces the number of tokens needed for accurate representation. While similar attempts in the past have seen limited success, the breakthrough appears to come from combining an explicit temporal encoder with a spatial encoder, enabling more efficient video processing. |
|[CoPS: Empowering LLM Agents with Provable Cross-Task Experience Sharing.](https://github.com/uclaml/cops) | CoPS is a novel algorithm that improves agents' sequential reasoning by allowing them to share experiences across various tasks, enhancing their overall learning and adaptability.|
