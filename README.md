|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v1) |This approach utilizes long-context LLMs by preloading all relevant documents and precomputing the key-value (KV) cache in advance. The preloaded context enables the model to deliver contextually accurate answers without requiring real-time retrieval. The authors propose that CAG serves as an effective alternative to RAG for scenarios where the retrievable documents or knowledge are limited and manageable in size. |
|[Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04227) |This approach employs LLM agents to perform the entire research process. Key findings include: 1) agents powered by o1-preview deliver the best research outcomes, 2) generated machine learning code achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, 3) human feedback enhances research quality, and 4) Agent Laboratory drastically reduces research costs. |
