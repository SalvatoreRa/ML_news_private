|[UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Multiple Corpora with Diverse Modalities and Granularities.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20734) |UniversalRAG is a retrieval-augmented generation framework that handles multiple modalities (text, image, video) and granularities (e.g., paragraph vs. document) to overcome the limits of traditional RAG systems. It uses a modality- and granularity-aware router to select the most relevant content format for each query, improving retrieval accuracy. UniversalRAG outperforms existing baselines across eight benchmarks, demonstrating the value of dynamic routing for robust, multimodal question answering.

|[DeepSeek-R2.](https://deepseek.ai/blog/deepseek-r2-ai-model-launch-2025) | DeepSeek has launched DeepSeek-R2, a multilingual and resource-efficient model positioned to challenge global AI leaders.|
|[Musk’s xAI Holdings is reportedly raising the second-largest private funding round ever.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/musks-xai-holdings-is-reportedly-raising-the-second-largest-private-funding-round-ever/) | Elon Musk’s xAI Holdings is in talks to raise $20 billion in fresh funding, potentially valuing the AI and social media combo at over $120 billion, according to a new Bloomberg report that says talks are in the “early stages.” If successful, the deal would be the second-largest startup funding round ever, behind only OpenAI’s $40 billion raise last month.|

|[Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21233) |Microsoft's Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning is a 3.8B parameter model that delivers state-of-the-art math reasoning, outperforming larger models on MATH-500. Trained via a four-stage pipeline—mid-training, fine-tuning, DPO, and RL with verifiable rewards—it combines efficiency with accuracy. Using 10M filtered CoT samples and tailored RL strategies, it shows that small models can achieve high reasoning performance when guided by carefully structured training. |
|[Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413) |This paper introduces Mem0 and Mem0g, memory-centric architectures that help LLM agents maintain coherence across long conversations by overcoming fixed-context limits. Mem0 uses dense language-based memory with efficient updates, while Mem0g adds a graph-based structure for better relational and temporal reasoning. Both outperform existing memory and RAG systems on LOCOMO benchmarks, with Mem0g leading in accuracy and Mem0 excelling in latency—making them ideal for real-time, long-term agent use. |
|[DeepSeek-Prover-V2.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21801) |DeepSeek-Prover-V2 is a 671B LLM advancing formal theorem proving in Lean 4 using a cold-start pipeline that blends informal reasoning with subgoal decomposition. It builds training data via recursive proof generation and trains with curriculum learning and RL for structural consistency. Trained in both minimal and CoT modes, it achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MiniF2F and ProofNet, showing strong generalization and bridging informal and formal reasoning performance. |
|[LLM Arena Pareto Frontier.](https://winston-bosan.github.io/llm-pareto-frontier/) |The chart compares LLMs based on performance relative to cost, highlighting top value models such as Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Gemini 2.0 Flash 001, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for their strong performance at competitive pricing. |
