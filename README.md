|[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837) |This paper finds that while RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves sample efficiency in LLMs, it doesn't enhance reasoning beyond what the base model can already generate. RLVR boosts pass\@1 scores but is matched or surpassed by base models at higher k, suggesting it merely increases the chance of sampling known solutions. True reasoning gains come from distillation, not RL, which narrows exploration without expanding capability. |

|[Gemini 2.5 Flash.](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/) | The next Flash model from Gemini has been released. It is a substantial upgrade from previous versions and matches Claude on a number of important STEM benchmarks.|
|[Our updated Preparedness Framework.](https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/) |OpenAI has revised its Preparedness Framework to strengthen safeguards against serious risks from advanced AI, introducing clearer criteria for identifying high-risk capabilities, more precise categories, scalable evaluations, and structured safeguard reporting. The framework will be regularly updated to reflect new technologies and expert input. |

|[BitNet b1.58 2B4T Technical Report.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12285) |BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first open-source, natively trained 1-bit LLM at 2B scale, achieving strong benchmark results with just 1.58 bits per weight. Using only 0.4 GB memory and 0.028 J/token, it rivals full-precision models like Qwen2.5-1.5B while being far more efficient. Its native 1-bit training outperforms post-quantized baselines, and innovations in architecture and training set a new standard for ultra-efficient LLMs deployable on diverse hardware. |
|[Claude Code Best Practices.](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) |Anthropic has released a detailed engineering guide on how to use its agentic programming assistant. It requires more specificity than traditional models. | 
|[Flexible Image Watermarking.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12739v1) | MaskMark offers a straightforward dual-mode approach to global and local watermarking through a masking-based Encoder-Distortion-Decoder framework.|
