|---|---|
|[Learning to Reason without External Rewards.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19590) |INTUITOR is a reinforcement learning approach that uses a language model’s internal confidence as a reward signal, avoiding expensive domain-specific supervision. This method matches performance on math benchmarks and outperforms on coding tasks, providing an alternative to existing RL techniques that depend on verifiable rewards. |
|[Forward-only Diffusion Probabilistic Models.](https://algolzw.github.io/fod/) | FoD presents a forward-only generative modeling framework that employs a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation. This approach allows for non-Markov sampling and delivers competitive image generation results with fewer steps.|
|[End-to-end data-driven weather prediction.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08897-0) |Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end machine learning model, replaces the entire numerical weather prediction pipeline with a machine learning model, by producing accurate global and local forecasts without relying on numerical solvers, revolutionizing weather prediction with improved speed, accuracy and customization capabilities. |
|[Decoding pan-cancer treatment outcomes using multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-024-00891-1) | Keyl et al. present an explainable artificial intelligence model-based real-world data analysis from over 15,000 patients across 38 cancer types, identified key prognostic marker interactions, and confirmed these in an external lung cancer cohort.|
|[Random Rewards During RL Boost Math Reasoning in Some LLMs.](https://rethink-rlvr.notion.site/Spurious-Rewards-Rethinking-Training-Signals-in-RLVR-1f4df34dac1880948858f95aeb88872f) |Qwen2.5-Math models achieve 15-24% performance gains by using completely spurious rewards such as random feedback, incorrect answers, or formatting rules, nearly matching traditional RL methods. This effect, however, is unique to Qwen models, thanks to their code reasoning abilities, while other models like Llama3 and OLMo2 show little to no improvement. |
|[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409) | This paper introduces Visual Planning, a reasoning framework that replaces text-based planning with image-based reasoning for tasks involving spatial and physical understanding. Visual Planning operates entirely in the visual modality, enabling models to "think" directly in images without language mediation. The authors train a vision-only model, LVM-3B, using a two-stage VPRL (Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning) framework. They show that Visual Planning outperforms text-based models on navigation tasks by over 40% in Exact Match scores, offers greater generalization to new scenarios, and provides better interpretability and robustness.|
|[EfficientLLM: Efficiency in Large Language Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13840) |This paper introduces the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM efficiency trade-offs across architecture, fine-tuning, and inference, using 100+ model-technique pairs on a 48×GH200, 8×H200 GPU cluster. Key findings include that no single technique optimizes all metrics: MoE improves accuracy and lowers FLOPs but increases VRAM, while int4 quantization cuts memory and energy with small accuracy loss. Efficiency is context-dependent, with MQA excelling on constrained devices and RSLoRA scaling better above 14B parameters. Techniques like MQA and PEFT also generalize well to vision tasks. |
|[Generalizable AI predicts immunotherapy outcomes across cancers and treatments.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.01.25326820v1) |COMPASS is a concept bottleneck-based foundation model that predicts patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using tumor transcriptomic data. It maps gene expression to 44 immune-related concepts for pan-cancer modeling and interpretability. Pretrained on 10,184 tumors across 33 cancer types, COMPASS outperforms 22 baselines in precision, AUPRC, and MCC, generalizing across drugs, cancer types, and cohorts. It reveals biological resistance mechanisms and improves survival stratification beyond traditional biomarkers. |

J1 reframes both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts into tasks with verifiable rewards, enabling consistent training across diverse tasks. Models generate thought traces, criteria, and self-comparisons before judgments. J1-Llama-8B and 70B outperform larger judges like DeepSeek-R1, while Pointwise-J1 mitigates positional bias with consistent, position-independent scoring. |
|[When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11423) | This paper uncovers a surprising issue in reasoning-augmented LLMs: while chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts complex reasoning, it often degrades instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on instruction benchmarks, CoT reduced performance across nearly all cases, with models like Meta-LLaMA3-8B dropping from 75.2% to 59.0%. CoT helps with structured outputs but neglects constraints during planning. The authors propose four mitigation strategies, with classifier-selective reasoning proving the most reliable fix.|

|[Infinite tool use.](https://snimu.github.io/2025/05/23/infinite-tool-use.html) | Large language models should only produce tool calls and their arguments, as relying solely on tools enables them to offload much of their intelligence to more efficient, specialized programs. While some developers are adopting this tool-use approach, it's mainly limited to short contexts and parts of the model output. This post presents examples of how the tool-use paradigm can enhance different fields like text editing, video understanding, and 3D generation.|
|[GenAI's adoption puzzle.](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/5/25/genais-adoption-puzzle) |ChatGPT's growth rate far surpassed that of PCs, the web, or smartphones, largely because it was accessible as a website, requiring no new hardware or infrastructure. However, ChatGPT’s daily to weekly active user ratio remains low. This could improve as models advance and new use cases emerge.
