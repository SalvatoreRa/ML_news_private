|[Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally.](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek) |Mixture-of-Experts models with many layers, like DeepSeek, need large batch sizes and high latency to maintain throughput—otherwise, performance drops sharply. This is why DeepSeek isn’t ideal for personal use, as single-user, one-at-a-time inferences run very inefficiently. The article explores this issue in depth, explaining why some AI models respond slowly at first but speed up later, and how throughput, latency, and batch size impact performance. |
