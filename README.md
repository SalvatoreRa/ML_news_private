## Research
|Link|description|
|---|---|
|[Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769) |Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought) introduces a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to reason in continuous latent space instead of natural language. By using the LLM's last hidden state as the reasoning state and feeding it back directly as the next input embedding, Coconut achieves "continuous thought." This approach enhances LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks, leveraging emergent breadth-first search capabilities for more effective reasoning. |
|[Asynchronous LLM Function Calling.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07017) | AsyncLM introduces a system for asynchronous LLM function calling, featuring an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, along with a fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to interrupt semantics. Efficiently integrated into the LLM inference process, AsyncLM enables concurrent generation and execution of function calls, reducing task completion latency by 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous approaches.|
|[MAG-V: A Multi-Agent Framework for Synthetic Data Generation and Verification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04494) |This multi-agent framework generates datasets of questions resembling customer queries and reverse engineers alternate questions from responses to verify agent trajectories. The synthetic data improves agent performance on real customer queries. For trajectory verification, it finds that simple ML baselines with feature engineering can achieve comparable performance to more advanced, resource-intensive models. |
|[AutoReason: Automatic Few-Shot Reasoning Decomposition.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06975) | This method leverages CoT prompting to automatically generate rationales for queries, converting zero-shot queries into few-shot reasoning traces. These traces serve as CoT exemplars for the LLM, enhancing reasoning capabilities, particularly in weaker models.|
|[Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens.](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/) |This work introduces a byte-level language model architecture that rivals tokenization-based LLMs in performance while offering greater efficiency and robustness. Using a dynamic approach, it groups bytes into patches based on next-byte entropy, dedicating more compute to complex predictions and using larger patches for predictable sequences. BLT matches or surpasses models like Llama 3, reducing inference FLOPs by up to 50%. |
|[Scheming reasoning evaluations.](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/scheming-reasoning-evaluations) |This paper evaluates six frontier models for their in-context scheming abilities, testing whether models deceive developers to achieve goals by bypassing oversight mechanisms. For example, Claude 3 Opus was found duplicating its weights to a new server and lying about the action. |
|[Researchers Use AI To Turn Sound Recordings Into Accurate Street Images.](https://news.utexas.edu/2024/11/27/researchers-use-ai-to-turn-sound-recordings-into-accurate-street-images/) |Using generative artificial intelligence, a team of researchers at The University of Texas at Austin has converted sounds from audio recordings into street-view images. The visual accuracy of these generated images demonstrates that machines can replicate human connection between audio and visual perception of environments. |
|[Causal Explanations for Image Classifiers.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08875v1) | This paper presents "rex," a black-box tool that generates concise explanations for image classifier outputs using a novel approach based on causality theory.|
|[Aligning Visual and Semantic Interpretability through Visually Grounded Concept Bottleneck Models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11576v1) | Giraffe introduces a transformer-based architecture that extends the ability to process significantly longer input contexts, setting new benchmarks for context length in open-weight models.|
|[Adaptive Caching for Faster Video Generation with Diffusion Transformers.](https://adacache-dit.github.io/) | Meta researchers have introduced Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), a training-free approach that accelerates video generation for Diffusion Transformers.|
|[Alignment Faking in Large Language Models.](https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking) |Anthropic and Redwood's research investigates how models behave when aware of alignment efforts, revealing they can exhibit alignment while retaining their original preferences. This finding highlights gaps in current alignment methods and offers insights for improvement. |
|[Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13147) | Reasoning is a critical area for models, especially in real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks often fail to measure stability across novel tasks. This paper introduces G-Pass@k, a new benchmark that evaluates a model's peak performance and stability in reasoning tasks.|
|[NoteContrast: Contrastive Language-Diagnostic Pretraining for Medical Text.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11477v1) |Accurate diagnostic coding of medical notes is vital for patient care, research, and billing but is time-consuming and often lacks precision. Automated coding using long-document transformers and contrastive loss functions has shown promise. This study integrates ICD-10 code sequences with medical text through contrastive pre-training, outperforming state-of-the-art models on MIMIC-III benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving diagnostic coding accuracy. |
|[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959) |Traditional time series forecasting methods rely solely on numerical features, rarely utilizing textual or semantic information about the task (e.g., predicting electricity prices or customer churn). When provided with this contextual textual information, language models significantly outperform all tested forecasting methods across a wide range of carefully decontaminated tasks. |
|[Finally, a Replacement for BERT.](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert) | BERT, a widely used encoder-only language model, powers nearly every Google search query. A new model from Answer AI, LightOn, and collaborators offers a faster, more modern, and highly performant alternative. It serves as a drop-in replacement, incorporating innovations like batch ramp to enhance overall performance.|
|[Thinking in Space.](https://vision-x-nyu.github.io/thinking-in-space.github.io/) |A research initiative focused on spatial reasoning and AI models designed to interpret and interact within three-dimensional spaces. |

|[Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000) | This paper examines the key components of the RLHF framework and their impacts, revealing the following insights: RLHF scales less effectively than pretraining for LLMs, with larger policy models benefiting less when using a fixed reward model. Increasing the number of responses sampled per prompt during training improves performance initially but plateaus at 4-8 samples. Larger reward models enhance reasoning task performance, but gains are inconsistent across task types. Increasing training data diversity for reward models is more impactful than boosting response diversity per prompt, though policy training shows diminishing returns beyond the early stages.|
